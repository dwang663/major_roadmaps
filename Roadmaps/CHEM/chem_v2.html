This course explores the intersecting performance cultures, politics, and sensual/sexual practices that have constituted queer life in the Caribbean region and its diaspora. Placing Caribbean queer of color critique alongside key moments in twentieth and twenty-first century performance history at home and abroad, we ask how have histories of the plantation, discourses of race and nation, migration, and revolution led to the formation of regionally specific queer identifications. What about the idea of the \\\"tropics\\\" has made it such as fertile ground for queer performance making, and how have artists from the region identified or dis-identified with these aesthetic formations? This class begins with an exploration of theories of queer diaspora and queer of color critique’s roots in black feminisms. We cover themes of exile, religious rites, and organizing as sights of queer political formation and creative community in the Caribbean.",

But, we also look closely at the richness of love and intimacy, the radical roots of self-fashioning, and the insurgent potentiality of mobility and aesthetic creativity coursing through the lives of her protagonists who cut a fugitive path out of slavery, ride the waves of Reconstruction, the Great Migration, Civil Rights era hope and organizing, and post-Soul searching.

Seminar discussions will be accompanied by short lectures in which concepts such as ‘trans-mediality’, ‘reverse-adaptation’, ‘screen-to-page’, ‘appropriation’ and ‘quotation’ will be discussed to build an understanding of how the ‘new’ approach reconfigures Nigerian novels.",
  "FILM 3537": "The course introduces students to an emerging genre of the Nigerian novel in which writers adopt narrative re-purposing strategies that invite transcription and adaptation to films. This evolving ‘Nigerian visual novel’, or ‘video novel’, is defined by its loosely structured, tabloid-themed and reader-friendly style, all reflecting the craft of Nollywood films, a thriving video film culture that emerged in the 1990s and has remained popular globally. Through the study of Nollywood films alongside new Nigerian fiction, the course will examine the techniques adopted by writers to accommodate the aesthetics of popular culture, to revive a declining readership, and to make literature more sellable.

  "AFST 3385": "The overarching aim of the course is to understand the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic in Africa in the context of a century of pandemics, their political and administrative management, the responses of ordinary people, and the lasting changes they wrought. The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people. The idea is to assemble sufficient information to facilitate a real-time study of thinking and deciding in times of radical uncertainty and to examine, too, the consequences of decisions on the course of events. There are of course so many moving parts: health systems, international political economy, finance, policing, and more. We also bring guests into the classroom, among them frontline actors in the current pandemic as well as veterans of previous pandemics well placed to share provisional comparative thinking.

This course focuses on British colonial North America, and then the early national United States before 1865, but readings cluster around the long eighteenth century.

In the second part of our course, we turn to modern humanistic theories about romantic love. Among the questions that critical theorists and philosophers have posed, we consider: How is love related to desire? Is sexual desire an indispensable component of romantic love? Is romantic love ultimately a selfish, exclusionary act, or is it about renouncing the self, losing the self in the other? In the third part of our course, we apply the insights of parts 1 and 2 to discuss case studies of romantic love in the contemporary United States.

  "AMST 3303": "From drones and autonomous robots to algorithmic warfare, virtual war gaming, and data mining, digital war has become a key pressing issue of our times and an emerging field of study. This course provides a critical overview of digital war, understood as the relationship between war and digital technologies. Modern warfare has been shaped by digital technologies, but the latter have also been conditioned through modern conflict: DARPA (the research arm of the US Department of Defense), for instance, has innovated aspects of everything from GPS, to stealth technology, personal computing, and the Internet. Shifting beyond a sole focus on technology and its makers, this class situates the historical antecedents and present of digital war within colonialism and imperialism. We will investigate the entanglements between technology, empire, and war, and examine how digital war—also sometimes understood as virtual or remote war—has both shaped the lives of the targeted and been conditioned by imperial ventures. We will consider visual media, fiction, art, and other works alongside scholarly texts to develop a multidiscpinary perspective on the past, present, and future of digital war.",

The result is a view of life, politics, and history in the middle of the 20th century that is as rich and expansive as it is fragmented. The social and political climate of New York in the late '60s is put into contact with memories of the rise of Nazism in Germany; reporting on the Vietnam war, the civil rights movement and the Prague Spring is refracted through the lenses of the protagonist's past life in East Germany and her new life raising her daughter alone in New York.

The goal of the course is to introduce students to foundational topics in science that must be, but sometimes are not, thoroughly considered early in the process of scientific inquiry. The first part focuses on reading about truth, facts and skepticism, causality, inference, deductive and inductive reasoning, research questions, and formulation of hypotheses and predictions. The second part considers aspects related to the actual development and implementation of a scientific study including considerations of types of study (e.g, observational, experimental), study feasibility, sample size, selection and validity of variables, power analysis, confounding factors. The third part considers the analyses, interpretation and presentation of results, offering introductory explanations of a priori statistical protocols; predictive and/or explanatory power and interpretation of both statistical significance and research relevance.

  "ANTH 0661": "This course deals with scientific questions of what we know about human origins and human evolution. It presents evidence from evolutionary and life history theory, geochronology, paleontology, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, phylogenetic analysis, genetics, archaeology, and functional morphology. It also tackles the issue of how we know what we think we know of our own ancestry over the past 6 million years. In other words, what constitutes evidence for human evolution and how is that evidence interpreted? Students are introduced to basic milestones in human evolution and learn how they have shaped us into the species we are today, using diverse lines of evidence from evolutionary and life history theory, geochronology, paleontology, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, phylogenetic analysis, genetics, archaeology, and functional morphology. We critically examine key debates that have taken place over the last century of exploration in human evolutionary research, learning how unconventional thinking and spectacular discoveries have shaped current knowledge of our origins. Students meet strange and fascinating historical characters, and then meet our fossil ancestors via the cast collection. Students also receive hands-on and interactive learning about the morphology, life history patterns, locomotion, social behavior, and diet of our nearest fossil relatives; observe living primates to assess what they can tell us about our own deep past; dive into data collection by locating real archaeological and fossil sites; and learn how molecular techniques such as ancient DNA have transformed understanding of the origins of our own species. By formally debating controversial issues with classmates, students learn what a surprising amount of information scientists can discern from fragmentary fossils, and are brought up to date with the most current discoveries in human evolution.",

What were the roots and social processes that gave rise to such systems? In this seminar, we explore archaeological evidence for the development of social and political organization and religious practices, using selected examples from East and Southeast Asia spanning approximately 5000 BCE to 1500 CE. We examine four key themes: (1) the origins and timing of plant and animal domestication, (2) the emergence and impact of early metallurgy, (3) patterns of interregional interaction, and (4) the rise of sociopolitical complexity. Using a comparative archaeological perspective—focusing on settlement patterns, urbanism, craft production, monumentality, and diverse material culture—we examine how both local factors and long-distance connections shaped these trajectories. We conclude the course with a reflection on the role of archaeology in contemporary society, particularly in countries where the past is actively curated, celebrated, and contested.",

Where traditional approaches took sedentariness and stasis as their starting point, we will begin with movement, displacement, uprootedness, and migration. Readings will explore how migration and movement have shaped the region's social, cultural, and economic structures over time. But rather than focus on case studies in particular countries, we will follow the flow of peoples, objects, capital, and ideas wherever they take us, from Egypt and Lebanon to India, the Netherlands, and Chile.

Food is not just a static object, but part of the global food chains that are constantly circulating, and part of the circulation with the human body.",

  "ANTH 4590": "From the highlands of the Andes to the lowlands of the Amazon basin and the frozen circumpolar steppes, from subsistence farmers and herders to hunter-gatherer groups, indigenous populations are changing their lifestyle so rapidly, and sometimes so profoundly, that it is difficult to follow the pace of the transformation. Indigenous peoples always fare far worse than non-indigenous ones in terms of health status. No matter where one looks, there are substantial health disparities between indigenous and non-indigenous populations in the form of mortality and morbidity gaps. We go over the epidemiological landscape of indigenous populations and discuss causes of death and sickness, which vary from population to population. We then expand on some of the possible interactive causes of these disparities, particularly the role that globalization and market integration is having in shaping the health situation of indigenous peoples. Finally, we discuss the current surge of Global Health Programs, mainly at academic or research institutions in the northern hemisphere and the contribution of anthropology to those programs.",

Through the lens of memory, we examine complex roles that our relationships to difficult pasts play in navigating issues we face today. This course explores this politics of memory that takes place in the realm of popular culture and public space. The class asks such questions as: How do you represent difficult and contested pasts? What does it mean to enable long-silenced victims’ voices to be heard? What are the consequences of re-narrating the past by highlighting past injuries and trauma? Does memory work heal or open wounds of a society and a nation? Through examples drawn from the Holocaust, the atomic bombing in Hiroshima, the Vietnam War, genocide in Indonesia and massacres in Lebanon, to debates on confederacy statues, slavery, and lynching in the US, this course approaches these questions through an anthropological exploration of concepts such as memory, trauma, mourning, silence, voice, testimony, and victimhood.",

Development is inherently progressivist: development projects strive to improve the present, and more importantly, the future.

It turns out that even the simplest projects to improve the human condition have a wide range of surprising, unintended consequences.

Overarching topics, grounded in medical case studies, include what it means for computers to \\\"think\\\" and how we understand what they are thinking about; the use and limits of scientific knowledge in making policy decisions; bias, fairness, equity, equality; the challenges of implementation of AI systems; safety and risk; and the human/computer interface. The course also provides a high level overview of machine learning, discussing opportunities, limitations, and tradeoffs. Ultimately, the course offers a grounded look at how AI is being discussed and deployed on the ground in medicine, equipping students with a critical lens for thinking about responsible and practical implementation and innovation when it comes to AI.",

More precisely, we introduce the Learning with Error (LWE) and the Short Integer Solutions (SIS) problems and study their unique properties, such as the fact that their average-case hardness is based on the worst-case hardness of lattice problems. Next, we cover lattice constructions of advanced cryptographic primitives, such as fully homomorphic encryption and signature schemes. Finally, we introduce some notions of quantum cryptography and explore the role of lattices in this area.Overall, this course offers insights into the foundations and recent advancements in lattice-based cryptography.",

Traditional approaches to startup education focus on the mechanics of company building—fundraising, product development, go-to-market strategies. Yet the founder's journey is equally about personal transformation: aligning personal motivations with business model and fundraising decisions, building relationships with co-founders and early employees, understanding when to pivot or stay the course, managing self-doubt, and continuously evolving one's identity and capabilities as the company grows. Through a combination of theoretical frameworks, case studies, narrative non-fiction, and direct engagement with successful investors and entrepreneurs, we examine how to navigate the most critical junctures in the journey of turning an idea into an enduring business. The course focuses on both the mechanics of building organizations and the personal choices that define the founding process. Students develop practical and personal frameworks for entrepreneurship while engaging directly with their own entrepreneurial aspirations.",
  "CSBK 2300": "An experiential workshop utilizing a combination of exercises, assignments, and readings designed to deepen insight into effective team leadership and to strengthen practical listening and connecting skills essential to a collaborative and inclusive team environment. Basic core skills include how to focus attention, empathic listening, asking powerful questions, expressing gratitude, creating psychological safety in your teams, giving and receiving feedback, and engaging with those with whom you disagree to understand their views, how they feel about those views, and why they feel that way.",
  "CSBR 2300": "This is a course on the self. It distills frameworks from philosophy, mindfulness, psychology cognitive science, and personal exploration so students directly learn tools and ideas to strengthen their relationship with themselves, deepen with others, and investigate what matters to them most. We study \\\"The Intrapersonal\\\" as we dive deep into mindfulness, inner friendship, the self over time, positive psychology, and self-change. Then, we study \\\"The Interpersonal\\\" as we explore projective identification, interpersonal friendship, romance and love, conflict, collaboration, and success. This course is designed to be experiential, personal, and holistic. Emotional depth, wholeness in the self, the ability to change, and the means of figuring out how we want to live are not innate talents people are born with, but rather, muscles–ways of thinking, being, and acting–that each of us can work on and develop.",

  "CSES 2300": "This course delves into the mystical tradition of Sufism and its artistic representation in 21st-century cinema. Through both film analysis and hands-on directorial exercises, students explore how Sufism shapes the filmmaking process—from narrative structure to the portrayal of mysticism. Students direct their own film scenes, using Sufism as a guiding theme, while engaging in every stage of production, from pre-production to post-production. A selection of Sufi-influenced cinema provides students with a comprehensive understanding of how spiritual practices can inform cinematic storytelling.",
  "CSGH 2300": "The objective of this seminar is for students to examine how capital and public policy can be mobilized to help the world meet the unprecedented challenge of limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, a critical threshold above which the world would experience far more severe climate change impacts. Broken into three parts, the seminar builds a theoretical base by studying the social and economic costs of climate change and the disproportionate impact on poorer nations and people of color, with particular emphasis on the rising costs in the U.S. in the evolving political environment. The second part of the course explores various innovative technologies to mitigate and adapt to climate change and how a collaborative approach involving governments, corporations, capital markets, banks, and philanthropies, working in concert can accelerate the deployment of these technologies. Led by a practitioner with a passion for climate change and 27 years of experience in investment banking and sustainable finance, the last part of the course includes an introduction to investing in climate technology and a discussion of what we all can do to effect change.",
  "CSJE 2300": "From \\\"It Happened One Night\\\" to \\\"Your Place or Mine,\\\" one of cinema’s most enduring genres has been the romantic comedy. Yet it has seldom received the critical and academic attention it deserves. Part seminar, part workshop, this course explores this oft-maligned genre through survey, history, and analysis, with special attention given to how its evolving conventions have both impacted and reflected changes in American culture, particularly with regards to attitudes towards race, sex, and gender roles. In addition to screenings, readings, and discussions, students put their observations to practical use in the generation and development of an original romantic comedy idea.",
  "CSMC 2300": "The sports industry, which accounts for 2 percent of global GDP, is made up of several publicly subsidized, self-regulating bodies; each has near-complete control over its sector. The lack of competition and government oversight has left room for widespread abuse of every kind—racial, sexual, financial, human rights. The work of uncovering this abuse is left largely to investigative sports journalists who in recent years have exposed the NFL’s coverup of its concussion data, the sexual abuse of gymnasts by team doctors, and the deaths of migrant workers building FIFA’s World Cup, to name a few. Getting the story requires investigative know-how and a working understanding of the unique ways the sports industry is set up. In this course, we learn the skills of investigative reporting through the prism of sports.",
  "CSMY 2300": "This course is an introduction to entertainment law, designed specifically for college students. It is helpful to filmmakers and musicians in particular since they learn how to protect their creative works such as film, sound recordings and musical compositions in two important ways. In the first phase of the course, students learn how to create, distribute and market content legally by examining how various legal issues affect entertainment. For example, the following issues are discussed: How sexual and violent can the content of entertainment be under the First Amendment? What rights do celebrities have against defamation and invasion of privacy? How do copyright, trademark and \\\"moral\\\" rights apply to entertainment? How does copyright apply to artificial intelligence generating entertainment? In the second, business-oriented phase of the course, students learn how to protect creative works by means of contract. Specifically, they review, negotiate and draft contracts which are customarily used in the film, television and music industries on behalf of producers and talent within industry parameters. This course is helpful to also any undergraduate who is contemplating law school since they are exposed to several basic areas of law, which entertainment law encompasses.",
  "CSSM 2300": "This course focuses on several major education policy issues in the United States by using New York City as a case study, and analyzing the effectiveness of the policy reforms implemented in the NYC Public Schools during the period 2000-2022. As the largest school district in the U.S., NYC Public Schools provide a microcosm of many trends in public education in America, and an excellent jumping-off place to analyze and discuss important aspects of education policy and reform. Policies have been aggressively implemented in NYC with interesting, sometimes positive, outcomes for students, and these reforms have implications for policy initiatives in public schools throughout the country. Issues to be addressed include school system governance, mayoral control, race and segregation, school size, school finance equity, charter schools versus district schools, school equity, and \\\"turnaround\\\" school models.",
  "CSSY 2300": "This class is all about what it means to write for the web. We consider a wide range of media, forms, and styles of writing. We trace some of the history of journalism and writing online, and the different forms that it has taken. We think about questions like: Does the internet even have a style? How can we use it to make our writing more timely and lively? This is a craft-based nonfiction writing course, and one that’s grounded in readings that are historical and sometimes theoretical—it aims to give students a sense of how the writing on the internet came to be what it is today. It also aims to be practical, in terms of teaching young writers about how the landscape of online publishing works. We learn about pitching, editing and self-editing, and paths a career might take in an increasingly digital media. We read more traditional essays, alongside Substacks by writers including Mary Gaitskill and Brandon Taylor; we look at New York Times critic Amanda Hess’s \\\"Internetting\\\" video series, alongside the poet Kevin Killian’s experiments in writing Amazon reviews.",
  "CSTC 2300": "When the 2010 Iroquois lacrosse team refused to travel to England on non-Haudenosaunee passports, it cost them their spot in the world championship in Manchester, which would have recognized their nation's sovereign status on the world stage. How might we understand this refusal, neither as protest nor as admission of decolonization's futility, but as a sovereign practice of constraint? What new political acts might emerge if we think of such limits, less as oppressive limitations, than as productive sites of engagement? Could such constrained activism avoid both (post)colonial government mandates and also the resistance modalities typically used to counter state structures (modalities that often engage the state on its own terms)? This course takes diverse Indigenous acts and theories of refusal as a starting point for examining related practices within a global, comparative framework. Emphasizing ethnographic disciplines, the course also draws from rhetoric, history, politics, and arts disciplines to unpack refusal's nuances as an endeavor defined by additive action as much as by restriction. Discussing current events, readings, multimedia, guest visits, and performances, students learn the practices of sacrifice and rejection that have remade both Indigenous and migrant/settler/diasporic political lives.",
  "CSTD 2300": "\\\"The American Art Form of Standup Comedy: Jokes as Culture, Self-Expression, and Folklore\\\" offers a deep dive into the history, nature, purpose, and craft of standup comedy. Students examine how comedy addresses and relieves tensions in American life around politics, class, relationships, family, sexuality, finance, race, gender, culture, and personal trauma. Students also explore how comedy creates identity, asserts culture and shares folklore through the emotional expression of shared laughter. In addition to studying a wide range of standup performers, comedy movements, and styles, students craft their own standup comedy set for a final class show. Through videos, podcasts, readings, and instruction on material generation and joke writing, students examine the broad purpose of this art form, uncover their own personal brand of comedy. The class workw towards a final showcase for the larger Yale community. This class is an academic, creative writing, and performance class. Students are asked to prepare material to share at the majority of classes and to collaborate outside of class in preparation for the class show.",
  "DEVN 2000": "This one-time-only course examines U.S. history from 1776 to the present, in advance of the nation's semiquincentennial (or 250th birthday) in 2026. Taught jointly by Professors Joanne Freeman, David Blight, and Beverly Gage, the course emphasizes the history of the nation-state and the contested nature of American national identity. The class explores U.S. political history broadly conceived–not just as a realm of presidents and elections and wars (though there will be plenty of those) but as a conversation across time between citizens about what the United States is, was, and was meant to be. It proceeds from the premise that the American Revolution was the first but not the last radical act of national reimagining in U.S. history.",

Can lab-grown meat revolutionize animal agriculture? How might urban agriculture and vertical farming impact food security and hunger? This transdisciplinary seminar considers the multiple roots and possible futures of organic farming, local food, urban agriculture, controlled environment agriculture, and related concepts, contestations, trends, and fads. Drawing from writings in agrarian political economy, science and technology studies, human and environmental geography, and the work of activists, organizers, farmers, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and beyond, we will examine the relations between land, labor, capital, technology, and society. The course includes three required Friday afternoon working visits to the Yale Farm at the end of the semester, which will ground our discussions in hands-on work in the soil.",
  "CSYC 2301": "Negotiation is essential: it is only the alternative to violence and coercion in public policy and a prerequisite to all economic activity. The food on your table, the electricity in your building, and the music in your ears could not exist without a long, complex series of negotiations. Yet, few of us consider ourselves confident, expert negotiators. We fear that we will be exploited and deceived (leaving money on the table) or that others will see us as too demanding or too greedy (and therefore untrustworthy). Game Theory in Action brings math and logic to the bargaining table. Students compete in seven simulated negotiations, progressing to business situations drawn from the sports, gaming, and entertainment industries. Poker is our entry point to game theory, teaching us to estimate expected value, detect patterns in opponents’ behavior, and bluff selectively to avoid being exploited. Game Theory in Action draws on academic literature, the instructor’s three decades of experience in high-stakes negotiations, and the expertise of senior executives in sports, media, and entertainment.",

Our reading is guided by a different \\\"ism\\\" each week, from 19th-century eroticism and exoticism, through mid-century cosmopolitanism and colonialism, to second-wave feminism and existentialism in the wake of World War II. These distinct moments in the development of Japanese modernism (modanizumu) are shaped by encounters with foreign cultures, and by the importing of foreign ideas and vogues. All the same, we question—along with modernist writer Yū Ryūtanji–the \\\"critique that says modanizumu is nothing more than the latest display of imported cosmetics\\\" (1930). We seek to develop a correspondingly nuanced picture of the specific and changing ways in which Japan understood and figured its relationship to the rest of the world through the course of a century.",

How does social change play out in literature, and, in turn, what role might literature play in social change? Where does the category of the ‘literary’ come from, and how does it relate to key political categories such as ‘the people’?

Our main object of inquiry, however, is the intellectual division that emerged between supporters and critics of the French Revolution, the historical event that prompted the modern political identities of liberalism and conservatism. Accordingly, we examine the political, moral, and economic theories of the Revolution; reactions to the Revolution from Edmund Burke, Joseph de Maistre, and other counterrevolutionaries; critical responses to their reactions, including those from Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, and James Mackintosh; and the impact of this debate on the evolution of liberalism and conservatism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Europe and the United States.

We start by exploring the fundamental theories in morality (e.g., Consequentialism, Deontology, and Rights Theory) and well-being (e.g., Hedonism, Desire-satisfaction, and Objective List views). We then use these theories to critically analyze particular moral and social controversies. In particular, we explore how these theories answer the following questions, \\\"Is abortion morally permissible?\\\", \\\"Is euthanasia morally wrong?\\\", \\\"Should there be limits on free speech? If so, when?\\\", \\\"Should there be limits on what can be bought and sold?\\\", \\\"Can the state be justified in interfering with who gets to parent children?\\\", \\\"How open should state borders be?\\\", \\\"What do we owe the global poor?\\\"",

  "EP&E 4255": "This course explores the nuances of two kinds of relationships: interpersonal relationships and normative relationships. The course starts with foundational work in relational ethics which connects ethics with moral accountability, e.g., moral demands, claims, blame, apology, forgiveness, etc. With a grasp of these views in place, we turn toward the morality of interpersonal relationships. Interpersonal relationships are a central part of our lives. As social creatures, they are essential for our well-being and the meaningfulness of our lives. But they raise important moral questions. For example, do we have special obligations to our friends, family, or co-national? Are we epistemically permitted to ignore evidence if it indicates that our friend or family has done something wrong? Is there a conflict between what morality requires and what is required for being a good friend or family member? What’s wrong or bad about being friends with an immoral person? We also explore psychological and moral aspects of these relationships, e.g., what does loving a person consist of? What reasons do we have to love others? Do we owe our loved ones debts of gratitude?",

  "EP&E 4264": "This seminar examines how the profound economic and social inequality in the United States interacts with our polarized political environment, and how these forces ultimately shape democratic processes and government policy. Throughout, we analyze the interplay of economic incentives and realities with political behavior and institutions. We pay special attention not just to what we know, but also to how we know it, highlighting contemporary empirical research from political science and economics. Substantively, we cover a constellation of topics at the intersection of these two fields: the relationship of income inequality and wealth concentration to campaign finance, the role of education polarization in determining who runs for office, the legacy of slavery and its relationship to identity politics, and the links between racial, economic, and political segregation across neighborhoods. Other topics include social media and internet news–which receive much of the blame for polarization in the press–the (in)effectiveness of campaign advertising, the determinants of voter turnout, the impact of social movements, and the shifting alliances among business, labor, and the major political parties.",

We first identify provisions of the Constitution that relate to economics and familiarize ourselves with methods of constitutional interpretation, including originalism and living constitutionalism. We then apply this guiding framework to our analysis of key Supreme Court cases that have addressed the Commerce Clause, the Takings Clause, the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and a number of other constitutional provisions that relate to commercial exchange and the legal status of corporations. Additional concepts we discuss include the countermajoritarian difficulty, the rational basis test, strict scrutiny, substantive due process, fundamental rights, disparate impact, public accommodations law, antidiscrimination law, and antitrust law. The guiding question we confront is whether the courts should a.) defer to legislatures in regulating business actors; or b.) overturn democratically enacted laws to protect the economic liberties of individuals.",

Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources (including goods, knowledge, information, technologies, etc.).

Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives. Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts that may include treatises, maps, travel literature, visual culture, material culture (e.g., currency), law, music, and performance art, students investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested.

Students theorize these connections by reading key works from across the fields of critical indigenous studies, food studies, philosophy, history, and anthropology. In doing so, we question the potentialities of enacting food sovereignty within the settler state, whether dietary decolonization is possible in the so-called age of the Anthropocene, and the limits of working within and against today’s legacies of the colonial food system.",

  "ER&M 3025": "This interdisciplinary course turns to refugees not only as remnants and survivors of past and present violence, destruction, and displacement, but as figures of many possible futures. The neologism combines \\\"refugee\\\" and \\\"futurisms\\\" to underscore both the limitations of existing frameworks about refugees and gestures toward emerging formulations and formations. Temporally, geographically, planetarily expansive and fluid, this course is inspired by the growing field of critical refugee studies and the rich traditions of Afro-futurism, Indigenous futurism, Asian futurism, and Latinx futurism. It draws on language, history, philosophy, theology, literature, art, and film to explore what it means to be human amid and in anticipation of different kinds of refuge-seeking futures.",
  "ER&M 3030": "Islam is the dominant religion in many African nations. Countries such as Libya, Comoros, and Western Sahara have Muslim populations exceeding 99%. In Senegal, over 95% of the population adheres to Islam, while more than 79% of Egyptians identify as Muslim. Nigeria has the largest Muslim population on the continent, with over 100 million Muslims. This course focuses on the histories, politics, and cultures of Muslim Africa. We examine the spread of Islam across the continent from the 7th century through trade, education, and jihad. Drawing primarily from anthropology, we explore the impact of faith on governance and social structures, as well as its interactions with other religious traditions on the continent. By the end of the course, students will: a) learn about key issues in the study of Islam in Africa, including Islam noir, Africanization of Islam, Ajami, and lived Islam, b) develop tools for studying how Africans on the continent and the diaspora practice Islam in various contexts and time periods, and c) acquire research skills for studying Islam ethnographically.",

  "ER&M 4021": "This seminar examines the historical and ongoing entanglement of Indigenous women and Anglophone legal systems, moving from early medieval England to the Pacific and North America. We begin with Old English legal codes that governed women’s rights and social positions in early medieval English societies, questioning how these texts established gendered legal frameworks that later informed colonial legal structures. As we move geographically and temporally, we trace the ways British and American legal systems constructed Indigenous women as subjects of empire, shaping their legal status, kinship structures, and sovereignty. A central theme of the course is Indigenous women's resistance to settler legal impositions. Through case studies—including early colonial legal battles, the forced removals of women and children, and contemporary struggles for justice and land rights—we examine how Indigenous women have asserted legal and extralegal agency in the face of colonial authority.",

We look at era-defining classical films from Hollywood’s Golden Age to contemporary films and media to consider narratives of self-transformation. The course traces and interrogates conceptions of self and Other, person and thing that are summoned in cinematic visions of passing, self-improvement, restoration, and instant alteration. Some of the questions we ask are: What kind of labor does the makeover recognize and efface? What does it mean to make-over a self, a house, a genre, a people, a nation? How do we come to visualize such changes, and how do we know what it is we see? We watch films by Charlie Chaplin, Max Ophuls, Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock, Douglas Sirk, Billy Wilder, Bob Fosse, Martin Scorsese, Janicza Bravo, among others. We read critics and theorists such as Barbara Johnson, André Bazin, Stanley Cavell, Lauren Berlant, Anne Anlin Cheng, Joan Copjec, and Roland Barthes to conceptualize the Hollywood makeover’s connections to embodiment, sexuality, material objecthood, and racial difference. Along the way, we consider the visual lure and theoretical stakes of \\\"making it.\\\"",

  "FILM 4140": "This course deals with the presence of jazz music in American cinema, mainly in Hollywood films. Beyond considering the role of major jazzmen and jazzwomen in films such as Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Charles Mingus, Benny Goodman, Thelonious Monks, Lena Horne, etc., we also analyze how jazz and African Americans are represented in Hollywood films featuring this music as a focal point or as musical accompaniment. Jazz music has served historically as a medium for early African-American presence in Hollywood films, via musical numbers and performances (Duke Ellington orchestra, the Nicholas Brothers, etc.), all while conforming to the demands of major film companies. During WWII, wartime films saw in jazz the opportunity to convey consent and support for the war (Birth of the Blues, Blues in the Night, Syncopation). By exploring films from the 1930s to the 1970s, and cross-examining essays by Paul Gilroy, Krin Gabbard, and others, this course calls into question these attempts and investigates the early silencing, instrumentalization, and reappropriation processes commonly characteristics of Hollywood. We contextualize this filmography by comparing it with films made by African-American film directors and analyzing their use of jazz music. The course illustrates how jazz music embodies a formal and political counter-power, evident through its themes and compositions, and demonstrates how films such as The Cry of Jazz, or The Connection capture this spirit.",

Driven by a sustained period of highly kinetic counterterrorism operations, the evolution of SOF has been one of the most significant developments in the military history of the 21st century. With that period of conflict now receding, and a period of sustained competition between near-peers dominating geopolitical dynamics, the role of SOF remains both contested and consequential. The goal of this course is to prepare students to think critically about the proper utilization of SOF—whether as informed citizens, military leaders, or civilian policymakers.

Students study the evolution of war crimes documentation since the 1990s, including the role of OSINT and DNA analysis of mass graves. An overall theme is accountability and transitional justice: exploring past international justice efforts and the challenges of truth-telling.",

  "GLBL 3358": "This seminar examines the war in Ukraine with a geopolitical lens focusing on its broader implications for both regional security and democracy. The outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022 quickly became a flashpoint in the region. Over two years later, the stakes are high and tensions are rising among transatlantic allies supporting Ukraine, both with arms and sanctions. This course evaluates the historical roots of the war and the fallout from a potential failure to effectively deter an authoritarian state from invading a sovereign neighbor. Our course of study includes the role of international stakeholders and multi-lateral institutions in the conflict, regional political and security dynamics and economic consequences. The humanitarian aspects of the war and its impact on civilian populations, human rights violations and the role of the media in shaping perceptions of the conflict is analyzed. Ultimately, what are the responsibilities of the international community in mitigating the human cost of conflict and the broader economic and policy implications? The aim of this course is both a comprehensive understanding of the conflict and its role in changing and shaping both security and democracy in region and further afield.",

The course does not purport to offer a comprehensive history of the bilateral relationship, but rather to examine the past in order to better appreciate the two governments’ worldviews and the reasons behind a more than 40 year-old antagonism that remains one of the world’s most dangerous. Our goal is to try to put ourselves in the shoes of US and Iranian decision-makers, internalize their respective narratives and assessments of the past, and seek to understand why each sees acts toward the other as they do. We focus in particular on the two nations’ sense of (in)security, Iran’s and the US’s regional roles and ties to Mideast state and non-state actors, the nuclear question and nuclear negotiations, as well as the role and impact of US sanctions. The course will closely follow unfolding events and examine possible future scenarios in light of these historical lessons. Guest lecturers will join to offer Iranian and US perspectives.",

These questions are as old as the United States itself, and the debate continues to rage today. This course examines these questions through the lens of the United States' recent engagements in the Middle East, focusing on the First Gulf War, the War on Terror, the Second Gulf War, Libya, Syria, Iran, Israel/Palestine, and the Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, and Oman as well as Ukraine/Russia. We consider whether the U.S. approach in each case was effective, not effective, or partly effective, and what factors contributed to that outcome. The factors we examine include but are not limited to U.S. security, business and economic interests, and human rights.",
  "GLBL 3930": "This seminar examines the challenges that must be addressed when the fighting has stopped. Once a peace agreement is signed, real deal-making begins. Former rebels negotiate with their military commanders about relinquishing arms and working for a living; communities look for \\\"peace dividends,\\\" refugees weigh options to return home; Governments try to assert authority despite how weakened they have become or new to the role they are; compatriots who opposed the peace settlement relentlessly try to undermine it. The international community, which often leads warring parties to the table, takes on a new role also, informing and sometimes deforming outcomes. Building a durable peace requires a sensitivity to the changing priorities of the signatories and international community, as well as the constituencies for whom the peace was achieved. Anchored in (but not limited to) the ongoing UN-supported peace agreement implementation process in Mali and the monitoring process of the Final Agreement to End Armed Conflict and Build a Stable and Lasting Peace in Colombia, the seminar considers peace-building processes from the perspectives of formerly warring parties, diplomats, NGOs, and civil society, providing students an opportunity to begin to catalogue strategies for building durable peace following conflict.",

This course delves into the concept of language crises and its long history from a philosophical and literary perspective, examining how crises of language are represented in literature and how they reflect broader philosophical questions about language, identity, and power. We explore different philosophical approaches to language, such as the history of language and philology (Herder, Humboldt, Nietzsche), structuralism and post-structuralism (Saussure), analytical and pragmatic philosophies (Wittgenstein), phenomenology and deconstruction (Heidegger), and analyze how these theories shape our understanding of language while simultaneously evoking its crisis. The course also examines how such language crises are represented and produced in literature and the arts; how authors and artists approach the complexities of language loss, and how crises help birth alternative systems of signification. Through close readings of literary texts by Hofmannsthal, Musil, Bachmann, et. al., we analyze the symbolic and metaphorical significance of language crises, as well as the ethical and political implications of language loss for (cultural) identity. Experimental use of language such as DaDa artwork, performance cultures, and \\\"Sprachspiel\\\" poetry by the \\\"Wiener Gruppe,\\\" as well as contemporary KI/AI literature, further complement the theoretical readings.

Most countries, in constructing their national identity, point to shared language, culture, or ethnicity. The United States, on the other hand, has been called a \\\"nation of immigrants,\\\" a \\\"melting pot,\\\" or a \\\"mosaic.\\\" These terms seek to describe how disparate groups of people from all over the globe have come together to form a nation. In this course, students grapple with questions of who has been considered \\\"American\\\" at different points in U.S. history, how the boundaries of this U.S national community have been policed, and why those boundaries have changed over time to allow some to become American while continuing to exclude others.",

  "HIST 0737": "This seminar explores the history of the Indian Ocean from the Red Sea region to South Asia, and onward to Southeast Asia through two creative works by Amitav Ghosh. The first work is In an Antique Land, an autobiographical account of his time in Egypt as an anthropologist in the late twentieth century that he interspersed with that of the history of a Jewish merchant in Aden and Malabar in the twelfth century when Indian Ocean trade formed the backbone of international economy. The second book, Sea of Poppies is the first novel in his epic trilogy on the Indian Ocean, which traces the journey of a diverse group people from the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia and China during the nineteenth century. This seminar breaks out of conventional regional fields by closely following historical actors on the ground. Each session explores several core themes for historical research namely commerce, mobility, labor, climate, cosmopolitanism, colonialism, and modernization.",
  "HIST 1114": "Are all politics reproductive politics? This course traces the reproductive history of the United States from the early nineteenth century to the present day. Questions about reproduction–and about not reproducing–are deeply tied to questions of gendered and racial rights; of bodily autonomy; of American expansion and empire; and of who counts as a citizen, or even as a human being. In the past few years, we’ve encountered new stories about everything from new and restrictive abortion laws, to immigrant woman who were sterilized without their consent, to new technologies in male birth control, to the inequitable childcare burden that falls to women during times of hardship, to the racist roots of foster care and residential school systems. In this course, we come to understand the historical changes in American reproduction to better understand the complicated roots of our current moment. By analyzing articles in newspapers and scientific journals, advertisements, film, patient and physician narratives, and exhibitions and material culture, students will understand reproduction as a site for empowerment and activism, as a site of medical professionalization, and as a site of health disparity. We examine reproduction capaciously, including pregnancy and childbirth, birth control and abortion, assistive reproductive technologies, and adoption and foster care. Our analysis is intersectional, and we consider what different identities meant for reproduction historically, as well as in our current moment.",

  "HIST 1257": "In 1485, England had just struggled through the internal Wars of the Roses, between Yorkist and Lancastrian factions. It was a medium-sized kingdom that had not even managed to control the entirety of its home island, and had a small part of Ireland as its sole overseas possession. In 1764, Great Britain had just won a decisive victory over France in the Seven Years’ War. It controlled the entirety of Britain and Ireland, possessed the second largest overseas empire in history, and was richer than any other European state. But then, in the space of the next two decades, the empire seemed to disintegrate as thirteen American colonies won their independence. This course examines how all that happened, both through the eyes of professional historians and the historical figures themselves. We are guided in this course by two critical questions: How did English monarchs, ministers, and merchants build the most effective European imperial state of its time? And what was the cost?",

  "HIST 1763": "This course explores the emergence of global health from the 1851 International Sanitary Conference in Paris to contemporary global health and examines how health initiatives and policies have evolved over the last 150 years. We begin by examining the impact of colonialism on health systems, highlighting the introduction of Western medicine that dismantled local health systems and established healthcare infrastructures that primarily served colonial and elite interests. We then explore the rise of international health organizations, such as the Rockefeller Foundation, the League of Nations Health Organization (LNHO), and the World Health Organization (WHO), and the role of multilateral institutions in shaping global and local health policy in the postwar period. We also evaluate health missions between the Socialist bloc and the Third World and assess the successes and limitations of these alternative visions for promoting health equity. Over the course of the semester, we examine the experiences of health interventions and eradication programs from the perspective of recipient communities and gain an understanding of resistance, contestations, and adoption of these programs. Challenging dominant narratives that portray recipients of global health projects as passive, we evaluate how marginalized communities have variously resisted, appropriated, and shaped global technologies and ideas. Importantly, rather than following a linear North (donor) -to-South (recipient) model, we examine how the contemporary global health landscape emerged as the result of the exchange of ideas, technologies, and local knowledge and expertise between the Global North and South",

  "HIST 2214": "This course focuses on the \\\"Early Middle Ages\\\" in the Mediterranean, European, and Middle Eastern worlds. This course takes us through a number of events that have long been considered great ruptures: the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West and growth of Barbarian Europe, the collapse of the Persian Empire and Rise of Islam, and the Christianization of the Roman world and dominance of Abrahamic religions in the Mediterranean and Middle East. We consider in what way these phenomena served as historical ruptures, and in what other ways we see continuities threaded across the centuries and across diverse locales. At the same time, we learn how vibrant this world was, where political configurations changed and developed, intellectuals battled with essential questions about the nature of God, and the fundaments of the modern world were laid. We consider these subjects and many more in considering both the creative and diverse medieval world, and the ways in which scholars conceptualize its different aspects.",

Looking at Britain's role in the world, we will undertake a critical appraisal of works of art produced in the North America, Caribbean, India, Australia and South Africa.",
  "HIST 2249": "This course studies the ways in which Jewish writers and artists turned European culture into Jewish culture, that is, how a minority group fashioned its own version of the majority culture. As European Jews encountered European culture and society, they had to grapple with a host of fundamental questions. What was Judaism and who were the Jews: a religion, a history, a culture, a nation? We examine the way in which writers and artists struggled with these issues in five media: memoir, theology, history, fiction, and painting, thereby creating Jewish versions first of Enlightenment, Romanticism, and realism (1780-1870) and then of nationalism, positivism, and modernism (1870-1930).",

  "HIST 2621": "This course aims to provide students with an alternative reading of the Islamic legal tradition. It upends the view that Islamic law was in some way allergic to change. Likewise, it problematizes the notion that the medieval legal tradition either lacked innovation or was rendered obsolete by colonial reforms and modernist critique. It approaches Islamic law through the speculative enterprise of jurisprudence (fiqh), the work of legal scholars to elaborate God’s most likely position regarding any legal dilemma. Through the literature and opinions (fatwās) of legal specialists from the ninth through the twentieth century, the class interrogates the relationship between change and continuity in Islamic law. We explore how jurisconsults balanced the doctrine of trans-regional schools of law with the local dilemmas faced by the communities in which they lived and served. Similarly, we consider not only the opportunities but also the risks that arise from adapting Islamic law to local conditions. The course challenges students to ask what is change within a tradition? In the debates and polemics of legal scholars, we contemplate the appeal and the limitations of reform within Islamic law, tracing how both have been contested and have evolved across different geographies and periods in the Muslim World. Likewise, we rethink the boundaries of continuity. We question how a legal school and a legal canon are constructed and revised, examining the ways in which both are capable of reinforcing – or imperiling – the Islamic legal tradition. Last, we explore the endurance of Islamic law in contemporary Muslim societies. The course reflects on the processes and the consequences of various projects of \\\"modernizing\\\" the Sharīʿa, asking how the institutions of the colonial and postcolonial state have reconfigured Islamic law in radically different ways.",

The course shows how key Latin American actors, institutions, and resources shaped the development of the United States as the dominant hegemonic power in the twentieth century. We begin in the nineteenth century, when both regions began to create alliances to combat the presence of European powers in the hemisphere. Then, we examine how US economic and military presence in Latin America was both welcomed and contested by different social sectors in both regions. We also emphasize how the Cold War dictated US strategy in the region, resulting in coups and revolutions, and how Latin America played a fundamental role in US foreign policy.

  "HIST 3197": "Museums are in a state of crisis. From calls for decolonization and repatriation to protests over human remains collections and unethical donor policies, museums and related cultural institutions find themselves at a crossroads, reckoning with their violent colonial histories while handling ongoing concerns about workers’ rights, systemic inequality, and their role in shaping knowledge in the public sphere. Whether addressing climate change policy, Black Lives Matter protests, fights for unionization, or Indigenous representation, it’s clear that museums are rich sites for critique in the history of science and beyond. How did we get here, and where do we go from here? Beginning with early modern cabinets of curiosity and moving through nineteenth century encyclopedic museums, controversial anatomical collections, and more recent natural history institutions, we investigate how museum politics and power produce knowledge, from the depths of their archives to sensationalized exhibits while questioning what an ethical, holistic museum might look like in the future. Amidst ongoing debates over controversial collections like the Benin Bronzes, human remains stored in universities across the United States, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 2023 admission of looting practices, and the American Museum of Natural History’s shallow apology for its eugenic past, the role of museums has expanded beyond the bounds of the academy, stoking universal struggles around human rights, international repatriation policies, and the politics of preservation, display, and loss. We bridge the classroom and the collection, visiting institutions around New Haven, practicing skills like provenance research and ethical handling of difficult objects while working towards a practice-based final project that suggests ways forward for museums and collections.",

Whether addressing climate change policy, Black Lives Matter protests, fights for unionization, or Indigenous representation, it’s clear that museums are rich sites for critique in the history of science and beyond. How did we get here, and where do we go from here? Beginning with early modern cabinets of curiosity and moving through nineteenth century encyclopedic museums, controversial anatomical collections, and more recent natural history institutions, we investigate how museum politics and power produce knowledge, from the depths of their archives to sensationalized exhibits while questioning what an ethical, holistic museum might look like in the future. Amidst ongoing debates over controversial collections like the Benin Bronzes, human remains stored in universities across the United States, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 2023 admission of looting practices, and the American Museum of Natural History’s shallow apology for its eugenic past, the role of museums has expanded beyond the bounds of the academy, stoking universal struggles around human rights, international repatriation policies, and the politics of preservation, display, and loss. We bridge the classroom and the collection, visiting institutions around New Haven, practicing skills like provenance research and ethical handling of difficult objects while working towards a practice-based final project that suggests ways forward for museums and collections.",

  "HIST 3214": "This seminar is dedicated to the reality and the perception of the night across time and in different cultures. We explore how religious and philosophical beliefs, political and economic forces, changes in technologies of lighting, human biology, and the shift from rural to urban and agrarian to industrial societies affected attitudes toward time in general and the night in particular. These changes influenced the perceptions, uses, and the ways different groups experienced nocturnal time, and how we act, sleep, work, interact, and even dream. The traditional binary view of day and night is questioned by presenting a more complex \\\"and dynamic face\\\" of the night. Nightfall provides multiple opportunities for dissent and rebellion and becomes an ideal space for marginal and subordinate people. Historical analysis, literary texts, medical and scientific writings, and primary sources provide the class with a cross-disciplinary approach to examine how the night became the abode of the ghost, the devil, the witch, and the dead, and how the night became criminalized, commercialized and even politicized. In our time, improvements in lighting changed the nocturnal world, but also had detrimental effects on sleep and dreams, and caused contemporary movements–aesthetic and scientific–to \\\"rescue\\\" the night.",

As a form of historical writing, microhistories allow us to delve deeply into a seemingly narrow subject in order to shed light on much larger themes. In this course, we use microhistories to examine the 17th- and 18th-century British Atlantic world as a space of immense wealth and violence, of expansion and dispossession, of cooperation and competition. Above all, it was a world of entanglements, in which peoples of the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe became drawn together in unprecedented ways. Throughout the course, students work to develop their own microhistories which explore these topics.",

How do the constraints on the pursuit and expression of \\\"truth\\\" change with the nature of the censoring regime, from the family to the church to the modern nation-state? What causes regimes to protect perceived vulnerabilities in the systems of knowledge they privilege? What happens when conflict between regimes implicates modes of knowing? Are there types of truth that any regime would—or should—find dangerous? What are the possible motives and pathways for self-censorship? We begin with the revolt of the Hebrews against polytheistic Egypt and the Socratic questioning of democracy, and end with various contemporary cases of censorship within and between regimes. We consider these events and texts, and their reverberations and reversals in history, in relation to select analyses of the relations between truth and power, including Hobbes, Locke, Kant, Brecht, Leo Strauss, Foucault, Chomsky, Waldron, Zizek, and Xu Zhongrun.",

  "HIST 3265": "Francis of Assisi is undoubtedly one of the most important figures in European history. As one of Catholicism’s most revered saints (often considered to be the greatest male saint ever), his radical message of voluntary poverty, humility and fraternity significantly revived the Catholic church in a moment of profound crisis, and has since been accepted as one of the foundational elements of European thought, receiving universal admiration from diverse thinkers who are often unaffiliated with the Catholic tradition.

We discuss how art history is inseparable from histories of extracted resources, exploited species, environmental catastrophe, racialized and gendered understandings of the ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, and politicized understandings of land as power. At the same time, we explore how makers across cultures approached the natural world as a locus of the divine, a source of inspiration, and the ground for both scientific inquiry and the pursuit of self-knowledge.

  "HIST 4995": "All senior History majors should attend the mandatory senior essay meeting in early September at a time and location to be announced in the online Senior Essay Handbook. The senior essay is a required one- or two-term independent research project conducted under the guidance of a faculty adviser. As a significant work of primary-source research, it serves as the capstone project of the History major. Students writing the one-term senior essay enroll in HIST 497 (see description), not HIST 495 and 496. The two-term essay takes the form of a substantial article, not longer than 12,500 words (approximately forty to fifty double-spaced typewritten pages). This is a maximum limit; there is no minimum requirement. Length will vary according to the topic and the historical techniques employed. Students writing the two-term senior essay who expect to graduate in May enroll in HIST 495 during the fall term and complete their essays in HIST 496 in the spring term. December graduates enroll in HIST 495 in the spring term and complete their essays in HIST 496 during the following fall term; students planning to begin their essay in the spring term should notify the senior essay director by early December. Each student majoring in History must present a completed Statement of Intention, signed by a department member who has agreed to serve as adviser, to the History Department Undergraduate Registrar by the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Blank statement forms are available from the History Undergraduate Registrar and in the Senior Essay handbook. Students enrolled in HIST 495 submit to the administrator in 237 HGS a two-to-three-page analysis of a single primary source, a draft bibliographic essay, and at least ten pages of the essay by the deadlines listed in the Senior Essay Handbook. Those who meet these requirements receive a temporary grade of SAT for the fall term, which will be changed to the grade received by the essay upon its completion. Failure to meet any requirement may result in the student’s being asked to withdraw from HIST 495. Students enrolled in HIST 496 must submit a completed essay to 211 HGS no later than 5 p.m. on the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Essays submitted after 5 p.m. will be considered as having been turned in on the following day. If the essay is submitted late without an excuse from the student's residential college dean, the penalty is one letter grade for the first day and one-half letter grade for each of the next two days past the deadline. No essay that would otherwise pass will be failed because it is late, but late essays will not be considered for departmental or Yale College prizes. All senior departmental essays will be judged by members of the faculty other than the adviser. In order to graduate from Yale College, a student majoring in History must achieve a passing grade on the departmental essay.",
  "HIST 3744": "Photos are windows onto known and unknows places; they are an inseparable part of how we see and understand the world. In the age of Instagram, smartphones, and #Filter-#NoFilter we are all photographers, our very own curators of visual microcosms. We produce and consume photographic images almost constantly. We are now simultaneously master, subject, and audience in a transnational consumerist visual culture. This is remarkable seeing as the technology of photography has only been around for the past 180 years. No one could have foreseen the selfie as a potential technological application. The advent of photography in 1839 as a means of visual knowledge production was entangled with the rise of modern disciplines of ordering and categorizing knowledge about both people and places. Going beyond looking at photography merely as a technology invented in and disseminated from Europe, this course attempts to analyze \\\"other histories\\\" of photography, by looking at how this global technology was appropriated locally in Asia, Africa and the Americas. It is thus a global social history of the technology of photography. This course endeavors to give students the tools to analyze photos contextually, materially, and in terms of their content by looking at the first sixty years of photography. Specifically, this course looks at the intertwined histories of early photography and the formulation of modern disciplines by focusing on how early non-European anthropologists, geographers, and archaeologists incorporated photography in their methods of picturing place and the populace. Through thematic analysis and examination of different types of archival photos, students learn how to analyze photos both in the larger context of other visual sources, such as paintings, as well as textual sources.",
  "HIST 3761": "Penetrated jungles, \\\"mother\\\" nature, and quests to preserve the redwoods – for hundreds of years, colonial agents have characterized environments in racialized, gendered, sexualized, classist, and ableist terms, anthropomorphizing nature along ongoing systems of inequality. This class traces shifting conceptualizations of nature from the early modern period to the present, focusing on how naturalists and scientists have described, collected, and displayed \\\"new\\\" environments and peoples while building extractive and exploitative natural history collections, from cabinets of curiosity to Yale’s own Peabody Museum. By analyzing methodologies like classification, conservation, and scientific communication, we will discuss how divisions between the \\\"natural\\\" and \\\"unnatural\\\" were created in western cultures along unequal ideas about human bodies. Critical analyses of sources across multiple disciplines will inform conversations about knowledge production with the goal of interrogating how these power structures have silenced voices and enacted long-lasting violences on both environments and the peoples inhabiting them. Using both primary and secondary sources while conducting original research, students will learn how binary and reductive categories have been used and abused in colonial science and beyond. This class will include visits to museums around Yale’s campus and beyond, with two of your assignments focused on the Peabody Museum.",

  "HIST 3768": "This seminar explores the history of right-wing political thought from the late eighteenth century to the present, with an emphasis on the role played by religious and pagan traditions. This course seeks to answer the question, what constitutes the right? What are the central philosophical, religious, and pagan, principles of those groups associated with this designation? How have the core ideas of the right changed over time? We do this by examining primary tracts written by theologians, political philosophers, and social theorists as well as secondary literature written by scholars interrogating movements associated with the right in America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. Though touching on specific national political parties, institutions, and think tanks, its focus is on mapping the intellectual overlap and differences between various right-wing ideologies.

  "HIST 3797": "From the ads on our computers and the oil in our cars to university endowments and the clothes that we wear, capitalism seems to touch every aspect of modern life. But what exactly is this force that seems so universal? How has it changed across time and space? This reading–and writing–intensive course surveys the global history of capitalism since the end of the eighteenth century, covering both the details of economic change and its interaction with society, culture, and politics. Students learn how capitalism has changed from the cotton mills of the nineteenth century to the cryptocurrency exchanges of the twenty-first; how its effects have been felt and interpreted in different ways around the world; and how historians employ a range of methodological approaches and sources to make sense of this history. Key themes include economic ideas; technological change; the tension between global interconnection and everyday life; and how both critics and champions have understood capitalism’s relationship to social justice and personal freedom.",

The senior essay is a required one- or two-term independent research project conducted under the guidance of a faculty adviser. As a significant work of primary-source research, it serves as the capstone project of the History major. Students writing the one-term senior essay enroll in HIST 497 (see description), not HIST 495 and 496. The two-term essay takes the form of a substantial article, not longer than 12,500 words (approximately forty to fifty double-spaced typewritten pages). This is a maximum limit; there is no minimum requirement. Length will vary according to the topic and the historical techniques employed. Students writing the two-term senior essay who expect to graduate in May enroll in HIST 495 during the fall term and complete their essays in HIST 496 in the spring term. December graduates enroll in HIST 495 in the spring term and complete their essays in HIST 496 during the following fall term; students planning to begin their essay in the spring term should notify the senior essay director by early December. Each student majoring in History must present a completed Statement of Intention, signed by a department member who has agreed to serve as adviser, to the History Department Undergraduate Registrar by the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Blank statement forms are available from the History Undergraduate Registrar and in the Senior Essay handbook. Students enrolled in HIST 495 submit to the administrator in 237 HGS a two-to-three-page analysis of a single primary source, a draft bibliographic essay, and at least ten pages of the essay by the deadlines listed in the Senior Essay Handbook. Those who meet these requirements receive a temporary grade of SAT for the fall term, which will be changed to the grade received by the essay upon its completion. Failure to meet any requirement may result in the student’s being asked to withdraw from HIST 495. Students enrolled in HIST 496 must submit a completed essay to 211 HGS no later than 5 p.m. on the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Essays submitted after 5 p.m. will be considered as having been turned in on the following day. If the essay is submitted late without an excuse from the student's residential college dean, the penalty is one letter grade for the first day and one-half letter grade for each of the next two days past the deadline. No essay that would otherwise pass will be failed because it is late, but late essays will not be considered for departmental or Yale College prizes. All senior departmental essays will be judged by members of the faculty other than the adviser.

Traveling across the spectrum of its divergent meanings—novelty, ingenuity, unconventionality, distinctiveness, authenticity, fundamentality, fidelity—we will track how originality came to be a desideratum of modern subjects, and how \\\"originals\\\" came to be their proper object of study and love. We will also consider how appeals to the elsewhere and erstwhile have buttressed the concept, reinforcing the presumed priority of a European center against a peripheral rest-of-the-world supposedly under its influence. Is originality a value to defend, or is it a resource claimed by some and denied to others? How have our increasingly sophisticated technical capacities for reproduction, replication, and most recently, generation, tested our intuitions about originality? Facing a seeming infinity of sources, as well as their forceful algorithmic channeling, what is original work today?

While this period is celebrated for its artistic, cultural, and intellectual achievements, it also had its fair share of intrigue, corruption, and moral complexities. Through love poems, secret letters, intricate networks, and political conspiracies, the course paints a vivid picture of the social and cultural landscape of Renaissance and early modern Italy. We look at the complex figure of Michelangelo, both as an artist and poet, focusing on his queer relationship with Tommaso de’ Cavalieri and his friendship with Vittoria Colonna. We then discuss how Renaissance art, often commissioned by powerful individuals–such as Isabella D’Este’s patronage of Leonardo da Vinci–was used to promote political or social agendas. We examine the alliances, betrayals, and murders that took place in Renaissance courts and how they shaped the political arena. Topics include the assassination of Lorenzo de’ Medici’s brother, Caterina de’ Medici’s agency, and Borgia’s rise to power as well as the use of poison as a political instrument in power struggles and schemes to eliminate rivals. The course highlights radical and sharp-witted women writers, such as Moderata Fonte and Arcangela Tarabotti, who protested against a patriarchal society, and gave voice to those who challenged gender norms. By uncovering these compelling narratives through the intersection of literature, religion, history, art, and sexuality, the course offers a more nuanced and critical view on this acclaimed era.

What is the thread that connects the Jedi knights of Star Wars and those that sat around king Arthur’s round table? How did medieval history and Renaissance poetry inform the expanded universes of superhero movies and fantasy literature, along with the inexhaustible fan-fiction that further extends and queers them? Chivalry, as a code of conduct and a network of symbols, inspired some of the most entertaining stories of the so-called Western canon, blurring the divide between high and popular culture. It offered storytellers (and nerds) of all ages a set of norms to question, bend, and break—especially in terms of gender. It challenged the very format of books, re-defining for good concepts like literary irony, seriality, and inter-mediality. This seminar proposes six pretty good trans-historical archetipes of fictional knights, combining iconic figures such as Marvel’s Iron Man and Italo Calvino’s Agilulfo, Ludovico Ariosto’s Bradamante and Game of Thrones’ Brienne of Tarth, Don Quixote and the Mandalorian.

The history of murder, violence, and criminal investigation is as old as humankind. Yet, crime is not always considered evil, nor is evil always associated with crime. In this course, we discuss how the way evil was perceived and crime was punished has changed throughout history. From mythical accounts of murders, to real records of trials of humans, animals, and even objects accused of homicide or witchcraft, we analyze how aspects of social status or gender played a role in shaping punishment across Eastern and Western civilizations. We compare codified-law civilizations to those in which custom, social pressure, and community ethics determined correct behavior. Four historical cold cases with accompanying evidence are presented for in-class debate, and… perhaps students may be able to help solve an old mystery! At the end of the semester, we recreate historical trials using the same crime, evidence, and participants, but following the law and procedures of each one of the historical settings covered in this course. Will the verdict and sentence be any different? Friday sessions alternate between writing workshops and field trips to Yale collections.",

Was he a political realist who taught us to seek for \\\"the effectual truth\\\" of things?

Was he a populist who sought to reanimate a taste for Roman-style republicanism? Or did he seek to bring about a new kind of expansive territorial state fuelled by war and the desire for empire? Machiavelli’s influence has been widespread throughout the modern world. But just because his writings have been used and misused for a range of causes does not mean that we cannot discover an intelligible and coherent core to his work. We read Machiavelli’s two most important works of political theory–the Prince and the Discourses on Livy. The latter is read along with the Roman historian Titus Livy who was Machiavelli’s major source for his theories of political conflict, leadership, and liberty. We then consider his influence on some selected nineteenth and twentieth-century political theorists who have appropriated him as the central figure of modernity. Throughout the course we are attentive to the interpretive and methodological issues at stake in the recovery of the thought of this great Florentine political thinker.",

We address these questions in a global sense as much as we can: while the culture of Western modernity will figure very prominently in the readings and discussion, we take a more enlarged perspective, with some of the readings being about, and/or from, places and imaginaries beyond the West: China, Afrofuturism, and South Asia. Readings consist mostly of imaginative literary works (short stories, and excerpts from longer novels), but also encompasses some non-fiction and graphic fiction. At least two weeks of class also focuses on non-textual culture (theater, film, paintings, and music that is connected to AI). The readings combine with assignments involving both traditional essays (midterm essay and final essay) and short assignments (assigned on a rolling basis, which let students explore the questions addressed in the course to a further extent).",

How should we situate AI, when viewed through the lens of culture at large, within the story of modernity? While the recent uproar concerning large language models (LLMs) in AI is only two years old, AI as a field has, however, existed for almost seventy years now. This course looks at AI and explore its relation with culture in a threefold way: through (i) historicizing (by looking at the historical cultural conditions that enabled or facilitated certain habits of thought or régimes of truth that led to present-day AI); (ii) analogizing (by tracing the similarities between patterns of expression in culture and developments in AI); and (iii) contextualizing (tracing how cultural artifacts have influenced AI’s directions and vice versa).

These literary works are exemplary in the way they define the multifaceted relationship between science and literature, resulting in innovative and influential experiments in narrative form.

Most of the course deals with meaning in spoken languages but students learn how the core principles apply to signed languages in a unit devoted to American Sign Language. By developing an appreciation of the scientific study of meaning, students can explore the role of language, and specifically meaning, in shaping courtroom decisions and in creating marketing and advertising campaigns.

What are our fundamental financial instruments and how and in what order where they developed? Are there fundamental rules behind the way in which humans conduct business? What roles have states and institutions historically played in facilitating or restricting trade? What sources and approaches are available to study trade in pre-modern times? Can business innovations from the past help us think about business in the present? To explore all these questions, this class draws upon data and case-studies drawn broadly from the ancient world but with focus on evidence from ancient Mesopotamia. With the benefit of a giant canvas of history we paint a detailed picture of how business developed through time. We look at examples where business was strictly regulated by state-controlled institutions as well as examples entrepreneurs would have to rely on informal enforcement mechanisms, such as kin-relationships and reputation in repeated interactions. We dive into the effects of shock on individuals and systems – from production shortages to pandemics. And we ask what happens when systems collapse, or value becomes immeasurable (as people have claimed for the 2008 crash). We study family-controlled business groups as an alternative to integrated and professionally managed corporations. And we observe how entrepreneurs adapted to face the financial challenges of states and dawning globalization. This course immerses students in the history of trade and draws on guests from widely different fields and disciplines to showcase the variety of approaches with which scholars address questions of business history.",

  "PLSC 2139": "Why do some autocratic governments spend decades in power while others collapse overnight? When do regime transitions lead to democratic outcomes? This course examines these questions through the lens of the 2010-11 uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. After the initial optimism of the uprisings forced a reexamination of decades of scholarship, trajectories of regime retrenchment, conflict, and violence led to renewed interest in long-running debates on the persistence of non-democratic regimes in the region. First, looking beyond the region, this course considers debates on how to categorize political regimes and engages with theories of autocratic persistence around the globe. Moving back to the region, we trace the trajectories of different countries before and after 2010-2011. We then engage with how scholars situated the uprising within long-running debates on how historical and colonial legacies; cultural, ethnic, and religious practices and divides; contemporary patterns of foreign intervention; repression and coercion; economic resources; and contentious politics influence contemporary political outcomes in the region.",

The course covers state formation, the role of law in empires and colonialism, the functioning of law under authoritarian regimes and during and in the aftermath of violent political conflicts, during the transition to democracy, and in the programs of transitional justice. We analyze the role of law in the legitimation of authority, contestations for political power, and political resistance. We ask, why do some countries end up with strong and independent judiciaries while others don’t? Why did some countries implement radical and comprehensive transitional justice prosecutions, while other countries chose to forget about the atrocities of the past? The class explores whether significant social and political change can be achieved through the courts. Finally, we delve into the challenges of implementing reforms in the legal field.",

How do interests and different groups, institutions, and organizations inform policy decisions? What constitutes an effective foreign policy? This seminar focuses on these questions through examining the sources of U.S. foreign policy and the process of crafting and implementing policy. We analyze and evaluate the sources and execution of key foreign policy decisions in historic and contemporary case studies from the end of the Second World War to the present. Key topics of interest focus on decisions to use military force, employment of economic tools of statecraft, the role of human rights and values, managing great power competition, and U.S. relations with the Global South. By the end of the course, students should have an in-depth understanding of what has guided major American foreign policy decisions and be equipped to think about what factors will inform future policy decisions.

  "PLSC 3356": "Few societies have been as reliant on experts as our own. As societies grow more complex and technology advances, so does the need for experts who have undergone years of specialized training. Ordinary citizens, firms, state bureaucracies, courts, and legislators constantly rely on experts to guide them in their decisions. However, this reliance is far from seamless. Opportunities to become a successful expert are uneven and often depend on circumstances beyond individual control. Specialists must counter public skepticism and compete with rival groups to establish their authority. Decision-makers are inundated with claims of expertise, making it challenging to discern between valid and dubious advice. Experts can exacerbate issues, fail catastrophically, or neglect public concerns to serve their own interests. Moreover, the increasingly specialized knowledge possessed by experts can seem esoteric and detached from everyday life, leading laypeople to view them with suspicion. For these reasons and others, the very notion of expertise has become highly politicized in recent years. Our society seems to be more and more divided between those who think that experts are indispensable to solve our problems, and those who see them as the root of our troubles. The course adopts an interdisciplinary perspective to explore these issues, drawing from both classical and modern research in sociology, political science, psychology, and philosophy.",

For 2025, the theme \\\"Remapping Dance\\\" engages with scholarship and speakers whose work creatively rethinks embodied performance in ways that might blur the boundaries between performance studies and the wider humanities, and who seek to remake the field of dance studies through expansive interdisciplinary and translocative methodologies. This fall, we focus on rescoring dance through migratory performance and dance labor networks to understand how movement is shaped by the connections and frictions of ever-changing communities. Guests include artists and scholars from within and beyond the fields of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies whose work generatively affords new pathways into and out of performance, suggesting possible futures for the field. Throughout, we explore how different ideas of virtuosity, risk, precarity, radicalism, community, and solidarity are shaped by space and place. We reflect on the ways in which performance has been unevenly recorded and disseminated to remap histories of the field. We rethink how local dance and theater economies are governed by world markets and neoliberal funding models and ask how individual bodies can intervene in these global systems.",

  "TDPS 4701": "An independent study should generally conform to the standards and procedures of the senior project, THST 491, even when not undertaken by a senior. If the independent study is a performance or directing project, the adviser visits rehearsals and performances at the mutual convenience of adviser and student. The project must be accompanied by an essay of about fifteen pages, worth about half the final grade. Although the paper's requirements vary with the project and its adviser, it must be more than a rehearsal log. The paper typically engages interpretative and performance issues as revealed in other productions of the work (if they exist). The writing should be concomitant with rehearsal, to enable each to inform the other, and a draft must be presented to, and commented on by, the adviser at least a week before—not after—the final performance. The final version of the paper, incorporating adjustments and reflections, should be turned in to the adviser no later than ten days after the performance closes, and no later than the first day of the final examination period. An essay project entails substantial reading, at least four meetings with the adviser, and a paper or papers totaling at least twenty pages. A playwriting project normally requires twenty new script pages every two weeks of the term and regular meetings with the adviser. A final draft of the entire script is the culmination of the term's work. Application forms are available from the director of undergraduate studies. Juniors may use one term of these courses to prepare for their senior projects.",

  "WGSS 2212": "While monogamy is central to Michel Foucault’s formulation of normative sexuality that arose in the 19th century (the Malthusian couple as adult, monogamous, heterosexual, married, and reproductive), little attention has been paid to it as a particular historical form of intimacy. We investigate this structure of intimacy through theoretical, historical, ethnographic, literary, and visual materials and think about the various meanings of monogamy historically as well as transnationally. Monogamy is entangled with relations of private property, with colonial civilizational narratives, with scientific theories about human nature. Polygamy in return has historically been understood as religious and/or cultural difference, and as a remnant of pre-modernity. The course weaves together theoretical readings that equip students with the tools to understand some key concepts that we need for our discussion, such as private property; the private family; colonialism and (cultural) imperialism; law and liberalism; and bourgeois morality with readings that more directly address some of the key ways in which monogamy is imagined, understood and framed. We discuss the turn to a recent rise in nonmonogamy in the \\\"West\\\" as a radical and \\\"liberated\\\" alternative to life-long or serial monogamy, at times featuring a critique of the private family, which constitutes a curious contrast to the nonmonogamy of religious and cultural Others of the West. Understanding the contemporary discourses and industries (books, podcasts, therapists’ youtube channels) around polyamory and nonmonogamy as a 21st century strategic unity, we analyze how liberalism has framed our understanding of sexual liberation and discuss alternative approaches to freedom.",

Beginning with a brief consideration of psychoanalytic conceptions of ‘the subject’, ‘subjectivity’ and their relation to social formations, this course examines some of the ways in which subjectivity has been theorized and brought under critical scrutiny by black diasporic, feminist and queer scholars. It draws on work produced in reference to multiple sites, including the UK, the USA and the Caribbean within the fields of psychoanalysis, social science, the humanities and critical art practice. It aims to critique the divide between ‘interior’ psychic life and ‘exterior’ social selves, as well as considering the relation between ‘freedom’ and subjectivity, including the extent to which ‘freedom’ might require rejection of ‘subjectivity’ as a mode of personhood.",

Since the advent of the \\\"modern world,\\\" race has been a defining, though often obscured, fault line along which the human enterprise has unfolded. So what would a racial accounting of humanity’s environmental harm entail? Who else are we as a species beyond the norms and aspirations enshrined by whiteness? And who must we become before Nature phases us out? If there is a future for humanity on Earth, it will not come apart from a serious reckoning with these questions.

But beyond uncovering the unspoken whiteness of \\\"the human\\\" and its environmental harm, this course further takes up the alternative visions of human being and nature expressed within black nature writing. By undertaking a broad survey of this literary tradition, we consider the unique environmental perspectives of those, who, once considered no more than livestock, were the nature over which their masters ruled and consequently could not so easily imagine their humanity apart from it.

This relationship is intricate and multifaceted, including computation for physics, computation with physics, and computation as a lens through which to understand physical processes. This course takes a more or less random walk within this space, surveying ideas and technologies that either apply computation to physics, that understand physical phenomena through the lens of computation, or that use physics to perform computation. Given the extent to which machine learning methods are currently revolutionizing this space of ideas, we focus somewhat more on topics related to modern machine learning, as opposed to other sorts of algorithms and computation. Since it is covered more deeply in other courses, we do not extensively cover error-corrected/fault tolerant quantum information processing, but we do frequently consider quantum physics. The course does not provide a systematic overview of any one topic, but rather a sampling of ideas and concepts relevant to modern research challenges. It is therefore intended for graduate students in early years of their program or research-inclined senior undergraduate students contemplating a research career. As a result, in addition to the scientific topics at hand, key learning goals include the basics of literature review, presentation, collegial criticism (peer review), and synthesizing new research ideas.

It allows students the opportunity to build on individual and group work on contemporary issues studied in the first year research seminars by proposing and developing a final design project informed by that research. Projects aim to reach substantial completion by the end of the fall semester for dissemination / implementation in the Spring term. The Independence of each student and project in the studio grants agency to pursue individual interests and brings a wide array of content and approaches into dialogue. At the same time, the semester is not a pure thesis format: the studio is intended to provide structure and common cause. In addition to individual critiques we will have group pinups and occasional shared deliverables. While each project will have specific content and an area of research, the studio pedagogy will be focused on the means of translating ideas into spatial, social, and political form. While projects may originate in each student’s interests, they are expected to address and impact the broader world. Students are expected to meet regularly with their individual advisors, and with both studio critics per the schedule in the syllabus. While the roles of critics and advisors often overlap, the advisor typically has more expertise in the content of the project and the critics will focus somewhat more on methodology: how to develop concepts and content from the research seminars into some form of concrete manifestation through design. In some cases, shared discussions between advisors and critics may be possible, but it is up to the student to synthesize feedback from multiple sources (including colleagues). The development of each project is ultimately up to its author",

  "ARCH 6005": "(Required of second-year M.Arch. I students.) This course examines the fundamental scientific principles governing the thermal, luminous, and acoustic environments of buildings, and introduces students to the methods and technologies for creating and controlling the interior environment. Beginning with an overview of the laws of thermodynamics and the principles of heat transfer, the course investigates the application of these principles in the determination of building behavior, and explores the design variables, including climate, for mitigating that behavior. The basic characteristics of HVAC systems are discussed, as are alternative systems such as natural ventilation. The second half of the term draws on the basic laws of physics for optics and sound and examines the application of these laws in creating the visual and auditory environments of a building. Material properties are explored in detail, and students are exposed to the various technologies for producing and controlling light, from daylighting to fiber optics. The overarching premise of the course is that the understanding and application of the physical principles by the architect must respond to and address the larger issues surrounding energy and the environment at multiple scales and in domains beyond a single building. The course is presented in a lecture format. Homework, computational labs, design projects, short quizzes, and a final exam are required.",

  "CLSS 7247": "In ancient Rome, declamation was the assumption of stock characters to debate fictional scenarios. It was a longstanding part of ancient pedagogy; teenage boys played out similar scenarios for hundreds of years as part of their training in rhetoric. It also became a mode of leisure for adult men at various points at Roman history—although that sort of declamation always had an air of deviance about it, since elite men were indulging in a sort of fictional roleplay that was beneath the dignity of \\\"real\\\" oratory. In this course, we examine Roman declamation through close study of the declamation scenarios and quotations preserved by Seneca the Elder in the early first century CE. We try to answer some fascinating but difficult questions. Why did Romans teach future orators and politicians through roleplay? What pleasure was there in the process? And what exactly did declamation teach? Was it merely skills of rhetoric? Or did it teach ethics too—the ability to imagine oneself as someone else?",

  "CPLT 5020": "The critique of capitalism is thriving. But what, exactly, is the problem with capitalism? Is it flawed, unjust, irrational, or harmful? Is it evil or foolish—or does it simply fail to function? In other words, on what grounds can capitalism be criticized? Setting aside the simplistic accusation of individual greed, three distinct strategies of critique can be identified. First, there is the functional critique: capitalism, as a social and economic system, is inherently dysfunctional and prone to crises. The second is the moral critique, which argues that capitalism relies on exploitation and perpetuates injustice. The third is the ethical critique, which claims that life under capitalism is fundamentally alienating or impoverished, preventing individuals from achieving true human flourishing. These three accusations are as old as capitalism itself. They appear not only in \\\"progressive\\\" or emancipatory movements but also in nostalgic and conservative responses to the profound social changes capitalism has brought about. They are found in theoretical debates, political manifestos, literature, and film. This course explores these three lines of critique through a philosophical lens as well as through an examination of literature and films that engage with the issue. The central idea—that capitalism is not merely an economic system but a pervasive way of life that as such warrants critique—is made vivid and comprehensible through this exploration. Readings include Max Weber, Karl Marx, Werner Sombart, Georg Simmel, Theodor W.

We open with readings from ancient texts from Mesopotamian, Greek, Latin, and Judaic cultures, and end with the U.S. Civil War. And in between we spend considerable time on the ways in which the advent of Christianity and, in turn, the Reformation, Counter-Reformation, and modern worlds influenced the practices and understanding of leave-taking. En route we explore how, for example, Catholicism sought to extend life into the third realm of Purgatory, why the Reformation sought to undo those imaginative excursions, and the extent to which the different faiths of figures such as Michelangelo, Shakespeare, and John Donne produced radically different kinds of finished—and unfinished—works. As we explore the transformative potential of the goodbye in literary and religious works, we also engage with more recent discussions from theologians, theorists, and therapists about grieving, transitions, and letting go. Our objectives are: to strive to understand the important role that leave-takings play in the history of Christianity and artistic expression, especially between 1300–1850; to probe the difference between religious faiths of early modernity with respect to rituals of saying goodbye and the afterlife; to sharpen our skills as readers, spectators, and listeners of works that engage with complex questions regarding the meaning of one's life and one's lifework; and to contextualize our readings within contemporary conversations about dying, grief, and letting go.

These territories, where states come and go and borders shift, have been inhabited by a diverse array of peoples speaking and writing in multiple languages. Writers here wrote in Ukrainian, Russian, Yiddish, Polish, German, Crimean Tatar, and other languages.

  "EALL 5670": "This course is an introduction to Japanese literature from the 1880s to 1980s. Our reading is guided by a different \\\"ism\\\" each week, from 19th-century eroticism and exoticism, through mid-century cosmopolitanism and colonialism, to second-wave feminism and existentialism in the wake of World War II. These distinct moments in the development of Japanese modernism (modanizumu) are shaped by encounters with foreign cultures and by the importing of foreign ideas and vogues. All the same, we question—along with modernist writer Yū Ryūtanji—the \\\"critique that says modanizumu is nothing more than the latest display of imported cosmetics\\\" (1930). We seek to develop a correspondingly nuanced picture of the specific and changing ways in which Japan understood and figured its relationship to the rest of the world through the course of a century. Creative and comparative perspectives are especially welcome, and assignments can accommodate a range of media and presentation formats to suit. There are no prerequisites for this course, beyond an enthusiasm for reading literature. All readings are in translation, however there is an opportunity to read short stories in the original language. To facilitate this, our second class each week is structured around break-out groups that allow students to focus on one of the following: (a) comparative works of Western literature, (b) works of Japanese literary theory, and (c) original-language short stories.",

  "IBIO 5360": "This course is designed to introduce immunobiology Ph.D. students to translational research and medicine. Each weekly seminar focuses on a specific disease with a significant immunological component. In-class sessions consist of highly interactive, didactic sections covering patient experiences, disease phenotypes, underlying immunobiology and pathology, and mechanisms of treatment approaches, including their limitations. Considerable student participation is required. Students are required to read and critically review assigned reading related to the weekly seminar topics. They discuss these papers in class, evaluating the methodologies, results, and conclusions, and identifying gaps in knowledge and potential areas for further research. Discussions are led by principal investigators specializing in human translational immunology, with particular input from clinician-scientists who treat patients in associated clinics. Students are presented with real-world case studies that illustrate the complexities and challenges of translational research and clinical practice. Examples of topics include: T and B cell contributions to the underlying pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, other autoimmune diseases, early-life immunity, immune responses to acute brain injury, inherited immune disorders, paradigms governing how anti-tumor immune responses are promoted or suppressed, current approaches in immunotherapy-based clinical trials, and immune responses to infection and vaccination. To promote critical thinking and the identification of new challenges and scientific questions in translational immunology, students are given weekly assignments. These assignments challenge students to think creatively about solutions to problems that hinder progress in understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapeutics. A term assignment, in the form of a research proposal, focuses on an independent study of a translational immunobiology problem chosen by each student. This assignment must differ from their thesis research. The combination of medical knowledge and interaction with translational and clinician-scientists provides a new perspective for IBIO Ph.D. students, broadening their basic science training. Exposure to the practice of medicine enables immunobiology (and other) graduate students to work more confidently at the interface of research and medicine, fostering collaborations with clinical investigators.",

We open with readings from ancient texts from Mesopotamian, Greek, Latin, and Judaic cultures, and end with the U.S. Civil War. And in between we spend considerable time on the ways in which the advent of Christianity and, in turn, the Reformation, Counter-Reformation, and modern worlds influenced the practices and understanding of leave-taking. En route we explore how, for example, Catholicism sought to extend life into the third realm of Purgatory, why the Reformation sought to undo those imaginative excursions, and the extent to which the different faiths of figures such as Michelangelo, Shakespeare, and John Donne produced radically different kinds of finished—and unfinished—works. As we explore the transformative potential of the goodbye in literary and religious works, we also engage with more recent discussions from theologians, theorists, and therapists about grieving, transitions, and letting go. Our objectives are: to strive to understand the important role that leave-takings play in the history of Christianity and artistic expression, especially between 1300–1850; to probe the difference between religious faiths of early modernity with respect to rituals of saying goodbye and the afterlife; to sharpen our skills as readers, spectators, and listeners of works that engage with complex questions regarding the meaning of one's life and one's lifework; and to contextualize our readings within contemporary conversations about dying, grief, and letting go.",

  "GLBL 5002": "Policy professionals engage a spectrum of stakeholders as they analyze issues and share findings. This work requires a refined set of personal communication tools for inquiry, collaborating, reporting, and presenting policy recommendations. Students in this course strengthen their skills by experimenting with the oral communication tasks related to policy work. We address the different types of information architecture required in synchronic contexts, explore the cognitive approaches needed for spoken interactions, build confidence in speaking to groups, and diversify approaches to persuasion. Students benefit from speech analysis technology and personal data visualizations of their linguistic choices. Throughout the course, students receive rich feedback about the impact of their words, the clarity of their messages, and their policy advocacy.",
  "GLBL 5004": "The primary objective is to equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to write persuasively as policy professionals. This semester-long course is divided into three units: the policy memo; the argumentative essay; and the speech. For the policy memo, students choose a policy topic of their own, then carry out every step of the policy analysis process, from defining, framing, and analyzing the problem to identifying and evaluating possible solutions, to building a case for recommendations. For the policy-focused essay, students identify practical rhetorical strategies to argue persuasively about their chosen policy topic in the public domain. Students practice deploying both emotional and rational appeals while confronting difficult normative questions about how to write persuasively without manipulating readers or devolving into spin. Finally, for the speech, students study a variety of noteworthy speeches that have had a real-world impact. Drawing on these insights, students craft their own speech. At the end of the semester, students have the option to present their speeches orally to the Jackson community. Students have the choice to take the course for a grade or Sat/Unsat. Priority is given to Jackson graduate students. In general, students are admitted based on the order in which they apply.

The purpose of the core requirement is to introduce advanced students of global affairs to the manifold ways in which history is discussed and perceived today. Different from the social sciences, history as a discipline is less about prediction and more about finding out where we come from and what challenges the past has bequeathed to us. It is also about grasping, in a critical fashion, that we know the future only by the past we project into it.",

NGOs, NPOs, political campaigns, think tanks, and government agencies more and more recruit policy analysts with the necessary skills to embrace novel, data-driven approaches to policy creation and evaluation. This course is designed to help students meet this growing demand. It is an introductory course in Python programming and data analysis for policy students with no prior coding experience. Unlike massive introductory classes, this course is deliberately small, designed to provide the necessary support for humanists to make a smooth and nurturing transition to \\\"tech humanists.\\\" Ultimately, students should be comfortable using what they’ve learned in further Yale courses in programming and statistics, or in research and policy after leaving Yale. They should know enough to productively collaborate on projects with engineers, understand the potential of such work, have sufficient background to expand their skills with more advanced classes, and perform rudimentary data analyses and make policy recommendations based on these analyses.",
  "GLBL 5065": "The purpose of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to Artificial Intelligence including a history of general AI (from Turing and \\\"the test\\\" through the \\\"AI winter\\\" to present); the possibility and fears of an AI that could supplant humanity and the sceptics who mock those fears as irrational; and the current, more narrow definitions and technical applications of what is referred to as AI including deep learning, neural networks and machine learning. From these building blocks, students consider certain applications of AI to national defense, climate change, and government policies with an eye to the tension between technological capability and ethical imperatives. The goal of this course is for students to emerge first and foremost, with a more advanced tech literacy, if not fluency and to possess a strong AI- and machine-learning working vocabulary. Further, students learn how to effectively differentiate AI from ML, myth from reality, and rational fear from speculative science fiction.",
  "GLBL 6285": "In the decades after 1979, China’s adherence to key tenets of the US-backed liberal international economic system enabled it to achieve middle income status. After the 2008-9 global financial crisis, however, weaknesses in the US model combined with China’s own sustained growth increased Beijing’s confidence in an alternative, state-oriented model that increasingly underpins China's foreign economic engagement. This course examines the basis of China’s economic strength as a precursor to investigating the Belt and Road initiatives, trade, investment, and development policies, international organization advocacy, business practices, and other aspects of China’s growing international economic footprint. These factors are analyzed from the perspective of China’s internal dynamics, competition with the United States, and overall foreign policy goals and are evaluated for their impact on the prevailing global economic order. Planned guest speakers include senior representatives from the State Department and the Embassy of China in Washington, as well as experts on Chinese investment in the United States and Taiwan’s role in global technology supply chains. In-class simulations focus on China’s WTO accession and the Belt and Road Initiative versus the Indo-Pacific Strategy. The course is taught by a practitioner who spent over a decade managing US government economic policy in and on China.",
  "GLBL 6610": "This two-term course, featuring guest scholars and practitioners from across the university, examines how artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to alter the fundamental building blocks of world order. Machines capable of sophisticated information processing, towards the frontier of autonomy, pose tremendous opportunities for economic growth and societal well-being. Yet the potential risks also are extraordinary. How can we build AI systems that are reliable, transparent, safe, scalable, and aligned with human values? Following an introduction to AI and survey of current research challenges, the seminar focuses on seven core areas where AI and emergent technologies already pose significant security concerns: (1) lethal autonomous weapons and the nature of conflict, (2) disinformation and the future of democracy, (3) competition and conflict in U.S.-China relations, (4) AI ethics and safety, (5) AI governance, (6) nanotechnology and quantum computing, and (7) outer-space development. For each of these sub-units, the goal is to equip aspiring leaders with requisite technical fluency, and to bridge the divide across the law, technology, and policy communities at Yale.",
  "GLBL 7165": "Environmental change is accelerating. Ongoing shifts in temperature, rainfall, storm intensity, seasonal patterns, species ranges and interactions, ecosystem health, and more already represent a profound shift in humans’ \\\"operating environment,\\\" to borrow a phrase from the authors of the planetary boundary’s framework. And the science suggests that the pace will not let up. If anything, we can expect more sudden and irreversible changes—tipping points—that will affect economies, polities, and societies as well as human health and wellbeing. This course seeks to build public policy professionals’ familiarity with policy-relevant aspects of earth system dynamics through reading of recent scientific papers, guest lectures by climate scientists, ecologists, and other experts, and explanatory lectures that connect concepts such as earth’s energy imbalance, atmospheric chemistry, the hydrologic cycle, carbon cycle, and to contemporary public policy pressures and opportunities.",
  "GLBL 6620": "This course provides students with a non-technical but rigorous understanding of how economics impacts policy and security issues. Given the integrated nature of trade networks and global financial markets, industrial, monetary and financial policy choices in large economies such as the US, the EU, and China have security implications abroad. These policy choices can play a destabilizing role, fueling global imbalances and/or triggering crises in emerging economies. They also offer unique levers of power: large economies can use their extraterritorial economic influence, either benevolently or coercively, to pursue foreign policy or security goals. Understanding international economics is therefore relevant for a development, foreign policy, or security practitioner. The course builds up the necessary theory and background knowledge to understand the current state of play and focus on possible near-term evolutions. This course has no prerequisites, does not expect students to have an economics background, uses minimal math, and is geared towards M.P.P. and M.A.S. students. Not offered in 2026.",

We examine the roles and responsibilities of members of the diplomatic corps, senior military officials, nongovernmental organizations, and international financial organizations in order to understand the skill sets required for these organizations to be effective. Through readings, discussions, role-play, writing exercises, and other tools, we learn how organizations succeed and sometimes fail in assisting individuals and nations in peril. We examine emerging regional hot spots, with an emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. We explore the challenges facing the governments, civil society organizations, and businesses in the aftermath of crises and the impact on citizens. We review the effectiveness of regional organizations like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and the African Union (AU) in assisting governments rebuild and stabilize their societies. We have several role-playing simulations during which students play the role of an individual or organization responsible for briefing counterparts on key events.",
  "GLBL 7070": "This course explores the evolution of information warfare as a national security threat to the United States and democratic countries around the world. Beginning with the KGB’s use of \\\"active measures\\\" during the Cold War, the course looks at how propaganda and disinformation campaigns became central to the Putin regime and how social media has facilitated their expansion. We examine the psychology of disinformation and how media \\\"bubbles\\\" and existing social fissures in the United States, such as racism and political polarization, provide ripe vulnerabilities for exploitation by foreign actors. Using Russia’s efforts in U.S. presidential elections, during COVID, and in Ukraine as examples of this new form of warfare, students explore potential policy solutions in the realm of Internet regulation, civic education, media literacy, and human \\\"social capital\\\" as defenses against this growing threat. Guest speakers with expertise in Russian intelligence, information warfare, psychology, and other disciplines complement the discussion.",
  "GLBL 7076": "This year-long joint Yale Law School/Yale Jackson School course is designed to facilitate student exposure to high-level national security policymakers and will address the question: \\\"How does the national security policy process work?\\\" Embedded in this question are subordinate questions about how that process works at different relevant departments and agencies, the answers to which look strikingly different from one to the next. The study of national security policy process touches the very structure and functions of the federal government of the United States, the national security tools at its disposal, the nature of policymaking, and its relation to law. Since its creation by statute in 1947, the National Security Council (NSC) has served as the primary forum in which the United States has engaged in national-security policymaking. The processes employed have varied across presidential administrations and different agencies. While they have been the subject of some historical inquiry, they remain in flux, and are largely opaque to the general public, even while they form an essential element for understanding some of the government’s most consequential decisions and actions.",
  "GLBL 7125": "This course provides an in-depth introduction and overview of the main human rights challenges in the Americas through the study of the context leading to abuse, as well as the engagement of the Inter-American Human Rights System (IAHRS). We begin with readings focusing on the social conflicts, inequalities, and other social factors underlying situations of rights abuse. We then turn to the IAHRS, evaluating its doctrine and practice on particular rights, as well as through a review of case studies of situations of conflict and rights abuse and the engagement of the system. The Inter-American Human Rights system is composed of two bodies: the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The seminar evaluates the jurisprudence and practice of both bodies. The course also examines the engagement, obstacles, and opportunities the system provides for civil society groups, victims, and advocates. Class sessions consider not only the norms of the system but also its internal dynamics: these present both challenges and opportunities for advocates. In addition, we explore the influence of the system, evaluating the impact of decisions and interventions by IAHRS bodies. Students also consider the Inter-American system from a comparative perspective, comparing rulings, implementation, and impact to those of regional and universal counterparts.",

The eminent Protestant professor of theology, Paul Althaus, declared in 1933, \\\"our Protestant churches have greeted the turning point of 1933 as a gift and miracle of God.\\\" The roots of Protestant responses to the Third Reich lay in the Imperial Christianity leading to WWI and the chaos of Weimar Germany. Recent scholarship has overturned older narratives of brave resistance and demonstrated that well-known figures such as Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer were anomalies in a Protestant culture of passivity and silence. German Protestant churches remained quiet as Jews were deported. Working with primary sources, students explore the mentalities of collaboration in churches (German Christians) and universities as well as the character of the Confessing Church.

  "HSAR 6553": "The development and transmission of knowledge during the early modern European world has lately been a dynamic subject of scholarly inquiry. Much of this work has focused upon the work of royal academies’ explorations of natural philosophy and the mechanical arts. This seminar seeks to move beyond that narrow geographic focus and descriptive taxonomies to consider embodied artisanal knowledge throughout the world in the period from 1500 to 1800. As Tim Ingold reminds us, embodied knowledge is a skilled, socially generated practice distinct from the innate talents of mechanical execution. It is a cognitive skill that prizes resourcefulness; efficiency of effort; and informed, intensive use of tools. This tacit knowledge, the intellect of the hand, is experienced and felt rather than written about and illustrated. Making things depends upon constant attention to the transmission of ideas from brain to hand and from tool to material, with feedback channeled back through the tool to the body and mind of the maker. This seminar combines reading, object-driven inquiry, and hands-on exercises to explore the role of materials, techniques, and human agency in the making of objects. Students expand their own approaches to the study of artisans and objects from many periods and places.",
  "HSAR 6565": "Architecture’s capacity to represent a world and to intervene in the world has historically depended on techniques of visualization. This seminar draws on a range of media theoretical approaches to examine the complex and historically layered repertoire of visual techniques within which architecture operates. We approach architecture not as an autonomous entity reproduced by media, but as a cultural practice advanced and debated through media and mediations of various kinds (visual, social, material, and financial). If questions of media have played a key role in architectural theory and history over the past three decades, recent scholarship in the field of media theory has insisted on the architectural, infrastructural, and environmental dimensions of media. The seminar is organized around nine operations whose technical and historical status will be examined through concrete examples. To do so, the seminar presents a range of differing approaches to media and reflects on their implications for architectural and spatial practices today. Key authors include Giuliana Bruno, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Beatriz Colomina, Robin Evans, Friedrich Kittler, Bruno Latour, Reinhold Martin, Shannon Mattern, Marshall McLuhan, Felicity Scott, and Bernhard Siegert, among others.",

The modern bourgeois aesthetic form par excellence may be routinely described by literary theorists as emerging and seeing its major developments in Spain, Britain, France, or Russia. Italy is usually excluded from this particular invented cultural trajectory. Instead of seeing this assessment as an indictment on Italian versions of the novel form, we interpret the supposed lack as an opportunity for rethinking the novel from a marginal vantage point. We read six canonical Italian novels and six minor ones that may be read as critical responses to the better-known texts, beginning at the start of the nineteenth century and ending two centuries after with the likely winner of the 2025 Premio Strega. Throughout the class, we ask what may be peculiar or eccentric about the Italian novelistic tradition by focusing, in particular, on the ways in which the novel registers and encodes philosophical debate about the nature of time and history; collective and individual memory; class and social mobility; Bildung and selfhood.

Finally, the course examines the intersection between the personal and professional through pairing memoirs written by scholars with the scholarship they published. Throughout, programmatic statements are combined with close analysis of the way scholars read their sources.",

It then considers early Christian debates on the roles of marriage, sex, and family, and analyzes the early evidence for the Christianization of marriage ritual.

  "MUSI 6740": "What does a musical amateur sound like? With etymological roots in the Latin amare, amateurism initially referred favorably to someone pursuing an activity for love rather than financial gain. Today, musical amateurs are often understood as those who perform outside of professional settings, receiving little or no compensation for their labor. In other contexts, \\\"amateur\\\" has become a pejorative term for those without substantial skill or talent—as George Bernard Shaw famously put it, \\\"hell is full of musical amateurs.\\\" These definitions, however, barely scratch the surface of amateurism’s complex meanings across musical practices and communities. In this course, we interrogate the shifting role and reputation of the musical amateur, exploring the fluid boundaries between amateur and professional. We also question the relevance of this distinction entirely, considering other ways to understand humans’ motivations for making music—and the standards by which that music is evaluated. Engaging with scholarship across and beyond the music disciplines, we consider how amateurs have provoked conversations around music’s relationship with capitalism, with expertise, with formal education, with pleasure, and with failure.",

It is also the site of the enigmatic sun-temples that had religious and economic functions. Remains of settlements have been detected in relation to the mortuary and valley temples associated with the pyramids at the site. However, the occupation and building activities at Abusir did not stop in the Old Kingdom but saw the construction of a Ramesside temple and the emergence of an important cemetery dating to the Saite-Persian Period (sixth century BCE) later on. The recent fieldwork by several Czech missions has resulted in some groundbreaking new publications, which are studied and discussed in depth during this seminar.",
  "NELC 7320": "This course provides students with an introduction to the New Kingdom royal necropolis at Thebes—the Valley of the Kings. Throughout the semester, students are introduced to several important subjects related to this archaeological site, including the \\\"lifecycle\\\" and \\\"afterlife\\\" of the necropolis. Students explore the origins of the valley, its development over time, and the eventual decline of this royal burial ground. As a class, we explore the boundaries and rules of death space: who has access and when? How did the natural topography affect the development of the necropolis over time? What influences do religious beliefs and political, social, and economic events have on the evolution of this sacred space over time? The overall goal of this graduate seminar is to examine this important site through a different perspective, to view the activities of western Thebes during the New Kingdom through a new lens.",

  "OTTM 6930": "This course explores nineteenth- to twentieth-century Ottoman society, culture, and politics through the lens of its gazettes. The first official gazette of the Ottoman Empire, the Takvim-i Vekayi, was published in 1831, followed ten years later by the second major newspaper, the Ceride-i Havadis (1840). Following these two earliest Turkish newspapers, the Ottoman press began to evolve independently of the state newspapers, with publications beginning to openly criticize government policies. This course focuses on chronological readings of articles and essays published in Ottoman newspapers to help students understand the nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ottoman society from direct accounts and perspectives. We read excerpts from popular newspapers of the period, starting with the Takvim-i Vekayi and other gazettes published in Ottoman script until the alphabet revolution in 1928. Students examine the evolutions of themes of women’s roles, fashion, minorities, social and cultural events, intellectual, literary, and political movements in the Ottoman (and early Republican) society. These readings also highlight the evolution of the Ottoman language through the contributions of influential writers of the period. The course emphasizes building a richer vocabulary, developing proficiency in Ottoman Turkish reading skills, and deepening an understanding of Turkish grammar and syntax. Students engage with key principles of textual criticism to achieve a deeper understanding of Ottoman society, linguistics, and cultural transformations as reflected in its press.",

  "PLSC 6235": "This seminar traces the historical and conceptual formation of the modern state, from its formative theoretical articulations in early modern Europe to its globalization in the twentieth century. The course begins by exploring how the emergence of the idea of the sovereign state in seventeenth-century Europe inaugurated a new way of thinking about the problems of political authority and legitimacy. This vision would mature over the eighteenth century, while also triggering numerous skeptical rejoinders that arguably culminated in pluralist critiques in the early twentieth century. While this story forms one strand of the seminar, its main focus is on the transformation of the modern state in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We examine how the rise of the social imbued the idea of the state with new purposes and how an expanded conception of administrative power facilitated a powerful reconceptualization of the state-society relationship. We explore these problems against the backdrop of the rise of democracy in the nineteenth century. The course also considers the globalization of the state-form in the wake of decolonization and postwar international order—asking how the modern state became the global standard, and with what tensions and contradictions. We analyze the intellectual formation of the developmental state, focusing especially on the expanded vision of executive power that propelled postcolonial founding projects across Asia and Africa. Readings include canonical texts in political thought (Hobbes, Tocqueville, Weber, Laski, Nehru), as well as more recent studies in the intellectual history of the modern state. The seminar approaches the problem of the modern state from a global perspective, engaging historiographies from both European and non-European contexts.",

  "PTB 5610": "The purpose of the Mentored Clinical Experience (MCE), an MRSP-specific course, is to permit students to gain a deep understanding of and appreciation for the interface between basic biomedical research and its application to clinical practice. The MCE is intended to integrate basic and translational research with direct exposure to clinical medicine and patients afflicted with the diseases or conditions under discussion. The course provides a foundation and a critically important forum for class discussion because each module stimulates students to explore a disease process in depth over four ninety-minute sessions led by expert clinician-scientists. The structure incorporates four perspectives to introduce the students to a particular disease or condition and then encourages them to probe areas that are not understood or fully resolved so they can appreciate the value and challenge inherent in using basic science to enhance clinical medicine. Students are provided biomedical resource material for background to the sessions as well as articles or other publicly available information that offers insight to the perspective from the non-scientific world. During this course students meet with patients who have experienced the disease and/or visit and explore facilities associated with diagnosis and treatment of the disease process. Students are expected to prepare for sessions, to participate actively, and to be scrupulously respectful of patients and patient facilities. Prior to one of the sessions students receive guidance as to what they will observe and how to approach the experience; and at the end of the session, the students discuss their thoughts and impressions. All students receive HIPAA training and appropriate training in infection control and decorum relating to patient contact prior to the course.",

  "REL 694": "Finitude, vulnerability, and risk are inescapable conditions of existence. Finitude indicates human limitedness and particularity, that we are one thing rather than another and will never be all things. Vulnerability names the universal condition of bodied being; every born thing dies. And risk is everywhere—financial markets, border crossings, susceptibility to illness, asking someone out—yet not everywhere the same. While all are vulnerable, vulnerability is also unequally distributed. Risk both enables and destroys. Finitude can be hard to live with, though there is no other way to live. Is it more important to focus on vulnerability as a universal condition, or on vulnerability's differential distribution along axes of race, class, ethnicity, ability, sexuality, gender identity, nationality (or its absence), age, geographical region, colonial relations, and so on? Or might this either/or present us with a potentially destructive choice that hampers our ability to ameliorate vulnerability's differential distributions? This course examines these concerns, asking what vulnerability means and how it is distributed; how vulnerability is lived and concretely encountered; whether staying close to the real vulnerability and fragility of our lives might help us live together better; and about the value of risk-taking for individual and social change.

Matthew offers much of value for the preacher: narratives illustrating the continuity of God’s redemptive purposes for Israel expressed through centuries-old prophecies and their fulfillment in occupied Palestine under Roman rule; an intricately wrought tapestry of teachings about ethical, missional, and spiritual dimensions of the life of faith, elegantly structured in five great discourses; dramatic storytelling that underscores what is at stake for those who choose ways incongruent with the purposes of God. In this course, we read rich exegetical and literary studies of Matthew by New Testament scholars, and we learn from expert preachers who bring fresh angles from homiletical theory to their engagements with Matthew. Students design and preach sermons and micro-homilies that explore the power of the Gospel of Matthew for Christian communities of conviction.",

Simultaneously, Christianity has continued to grow rapidly in post-independence Africa. In much of Africa south of the Sahara, decolonization efforts coincided with the period of the greatest Christian expansion in history. Africa is now the continent with the highest population of Christians. This course examines this conundrum through critical engagement with theories, literature, and data from the continent. Students explore the historiographic, political, social, economic, and demographic dimensions of this discussion. They engage with key theories regarding African Christianity in the context of a colonial history. The course surveys contemporary issues in urban, educational, social, and cultural spheres. Additionally, students consider gender perspectives on coloniality as it pertains to religion and politics.

But the course also challenges its own title as misleadingly clear cut, as the boundaries between groups were themselves continuously subject to revision and contestation.

  "REL 7205": "The medieval practice of preaching experienced a remarkable shift in the early fourteenth century. Meister Eckhart and John Tauler, two German mystics, preached in vernacular rather than in ecclesiastical Latin. While they were not the first to do so, they shaped a new style that actively engaged their audiences. Metaphors inspired the listeners to embark on a spiritual journey toward God. The mystical framework which both preachers provided aimed to transcend temporal boundaries without dismissing earthly reality. The faithful were invited to view their lives as transcendent for the divine here and now. The preacher became a spiritual guide. Understanding these sermons requires situating them in their historical backdrop, 700 years ago, during a period when the Dominican Order—of which Eckhart and Tauler were members—flourished across Europe. A notable issue for the preachers was addressing women seeking religious knowledge. The sermons reveal that male priests not only taught them but learned from them as well. The old texts might sound foreign in our times. Yet these medieval sermons might encourage us to think more deeply about contemporary ways of preaching and the purposes of homiletical theology writ more broadly. Eckhart’s and Tauler’s sermons on the Gospel of John, as we find them here, are set up to disclose intangible spiritual mysteries and to encourage the faithful to experience God in transformative ways. Their message remains an inspiring call, even today.",

Recent scholarship has overturned older narratives of brave resistance and demonstrated that well-known figures such as Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer were anomalies in a Protestant culture of passivity and silence. German Protestant churches remained quiet as Jews were deported. Working with primary sources, students explore the mentalities of collaboration in churches (German Christians) and universities, as well as the character of the Confessing Church.

  "REL 780": "African American religion played a significant role in the modern civil rights movement, 1954–1968. It represented one example in the modern historical period that reflected the centrality of religion in shaping political and social movements for and against racial segregation. The modern civil rights movement remains a landmark event in U.S. religious and political history and continues to influence policy debates, movements, and goals in our present moment. In fact, many pundits often privilege the modern civil rights movement as a barometer that determines the essence of Black religion in U.S. history. To be sure, it is impossible to understand the history of the modern civil rights movement without African American religion. Yet American popular narratives focus exclusively on a network of African American male clergy and their mobilizing social action for racial integration obscures a range of people and organizations and consequently theologies and political strategies that also highlight important aspects of African American religion in the historical period. Thus, this course critically examines the faith perspectives of a range of agents and organizations to illuminate the multiplicity and contentiousness that also marked African American religion(s) and the broader modern civil rights movement in the second half of the twentieth century. This course considers the role of Black religion in shaping competing political strategies and goals, leadership models, views on gender and sexuality, and class and urban poverty, from 1954–1968. The objective of this course aims to deepen our understanding of African American religion and the modern civil rights movement in the later twentieth century by critically engaging a range of historical figures, organizations, ideologies, and events. The course challenges popular, conventional frameworks of Black religion and the modern civil rights movement. Additionally, the course encourages students to rethink Black religion and the civil rights movement in light of our current political moment. Area III.",

The first followers of Jesus shared a life-changing experience that, through Jesus Christ, they had been reconciled with God, and it had been made possible for them to live in their right relationship with God as humanity had not done since before the Fall. That conviction still frames Christians’ understanding of God, Jesus Christ, human existence, and all human relationships. Although Christians have always been convinced that Jesus Christ saves, however, they have debated endlessly how Christ saves. From the earliest writings on, Christians have understood salvation as a form of sacrifice, ransom, rescue, redemption, reconciliation, supplicatory offering, exemplarity, and more. No one image or model has ever been regarded as orthodox at the expense of others, and each contributes something distinctive to the way Christians understand God’s action through Christ. This course combines history and theology to explore the rich diversity of early Christian images, stories, and models of how Christ saves that developed between the first and fifth centuries. We locate different ideas in their Jewish and gentile contexts, investigating where they come from and why they are powerful for different writers and communities. We consider the theological strengths and weaknesses of different ideas and ask why some are more popular than others now. We excavate one long-forgotten model from the New Testament and discuss whether it should be revived. We draw on some modern theologians to ask which ancient models best meet the needs of all those—both sinful and suffering—who need to be reconciled with God. Area I, Area II, and Area III.",

Through a threefold framework of moral analysis, moral articulation, and moral action, students are invited to examine how public theology has impacted the most significant advances in public policy in American history and why pastors and theologians of our time must practice in the tradition of moral leaders who have challenged systemic oppression in the public square and guided critical public policy shifts over the past two centuries. While it is commonplace in American public life to acknowledge that we are, as a people, \\\"more divided than ever,\\\" conversations about critical issues impacting our communities are consistently framed by a shared narrative of left versus right, liberal versus conservative, progressive versus traditional. This framing allows for a distorted moral narrative that focuses religious leadership and moral concerns either on a narrow set of personal issues or on wedge issues designed to perpetuate the left/right frame. Religion has been co-opted in American public life to serve the narrow interests of an extreme minority.

The course’s attention to developments in the global South challenges the proprietorial control of mission studies by northern churches in theology, mission, history, and theological education. The readings begin with the influential theories of translation by Lamin Sanneh and Andrew Walls, which shaped the field of World Christianity studies in the late 1980s. From there, the course covers various themes, including history, migration, mission, and contemporary issues. Students also encounter aspects of indigenous Christian impulses from around the globe, providing insight into diverse expressions of faith.

  "HIST 3741": "Talks of \\\"world order\\\" abound today. How did we come to think this way, how has it shaped how we act, and to what effects? This seminar introduces students to the field of global history through a study of ideas of world order in the twentieth century. As the Eurocentric world order of the nineteenth century was shattered by global conflicts, competing worldmaking projects arose, prompting intellectuals and social scientists to race to comprehend them. The identification or declaration of a certain emerging order was often also a political intervention. Thus, to study the trajectory of the world order in the last century, we need a combined toolkit of international history and intellectual history. After surveying the political and intellectual impacts of the world wars, we will pay special attention to the twin processes of Cold War and decolonization, their origins and their aftermath. Through topics such as war and revolution, modernization and development, nationalism and capitalist globalization, students will be equipped to think critically about contemporary questions: Are we entering a new Cold War? Is empire a thing of the past? Can history inform foreign policy? We will also pay attention to world order as intellectually experienced by historical actors, especially experiences of disorder and imaginations of a new world in an eventful century. With travelers, novelists, and social scientists as well as statesmen as our guides, we will dwell on how moments of crisis and rupture such as global wars and violence, imperial dissolution, and the rapid, uneven development of capitalism gave rise to not only new institutional experiments but also new forms of subjectivity and imagination, all of which help make any idea of order plausible.",

Topics include the literary and archaeological evidence for early Christian attitudes to visual representation; contexts of manufacture; the social and economic basis of patronage; Roman political influence on Christian iconography; development of new genres of imagery; and the role of imperial patronage in the transformation of civic spaces.",
  "GLBL 7575": "Intelligence work is both art and a science—with a little random chance thrown in. This is often made most clear when dealing with intelligence on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and national policymaking. In this course students learn the historical development of American intelligence, understand the role of various intelligence collection techniques, understand how the intelligence mission relates to national security, and understand intelligence successes and failures all through the lens of WMD threats from the Cold War to today. The course relies heavily on actual case studies (and intelligence professionals who worked those cases) to make key points on the insights strategic intelligence can provide and its limitations. The final class exercise is to write a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE)—the Intelligence Community’s authoritative assessment on intelligence related to a key national security issue.",

  "C&MP 5610": "The purpose of the Mentored Clinical Experience (MCE), an MRSP-specific course, is to permit students to gain a deep understanding of and appreciation for the interface between basic biomedical research and its application to clinical practice. The MCE is intended to integrate basic and translational research with direct exposure to clinical medicine and patients afflicted with the diseases or conditions under discussion. The course provides a foundation and a critically important forum for class discussion because each module stimulates students to explore a disease process in depth over four ninety-minute sessions led by expert clinician-scientists. The structure incorporates four perspectives to introduce the students to a particular disease or condition and then encourages them to probe areas that are not understood or fully resolved so they can appreciate the value and challenge inherent in using basic science to enhance clinical medicine. Students are provided biomedical resource material for background to the sessions as well as articles or other publicly available information that offers insight to the perspective from the non-scientific world. During this course students meet with patients who have experienced the disease and/or visit and explore facilities associated with diagnosis and treatment of the disease process. Students are expected to prepare for sessions, to participate actively, and to be scrupulously respectful of patients and patient facilities. Prior to one of the sessions students receive guidance as to what they will observe and how to approach the experience; and at the end of the session, the students discuss their thoughts and impressions. All students receive HIPAA training and appropriate training in infection control and decorum relating to patient contact prior to the course.",

We will give little focus to empirical questions (such as, \\\"Does ethical business pay?\\\") or descriptive questions (such as, \\\"Why do people engage in unethical behavior?\\\"). Rather, most of the focus will be on learning tools for reasoning about what is ethical and unethical in business. Questions addressed include \\\"In whose interests should firms be managed?,\\\" \\\"What rules guide firms’ engagement with customers?,\\\" and \\\"Should firms try to solve social problems?\\\" We will discover the tools we use for reasoning about right and wrong through discussion and debate about the readings, including on Canvas forums.

It should be no surprise that skill in interpersonal relationships is one of the most frequent determinants of managerial success or failure. This course is designed to help students learn some of the skills necessary for successfully navigating and leading in the face of fast-paced, complex human interaction. The central focus is to increase students' ability to understand and diagnose interpersonal dynamics as well as to increase personal understanding of how they impact others. This course is a memory-making, powerful and even transformational experience for many students. While readings and group exercises are used to begin discussion, the core learning material emerges in small group interaction. Students learn how they function in small groups and how they relate to others from feedback and reaction of other class members. As such, students planning to enroll should understand that the course methodologies are likely quite different than most courses you have taken to date. Much of the learning will emerge from a) personal reflection on interpersonal and group dynamics and b) the ability/willingness to learn interpersonally from experience, risk-taking, self-disclosure, and feedback. Interested students are encouraged to attend first session to better understand this unique course experience.

New markets developed, state assets were privatized, and novel business ventures proliferated. Even China, which retained its Communist political system, joined the capitalist economic order with a vengeance at home and abroad. The end of the Cold War also reshaped business-government relations in the West, as the threatening shadow of an alternative to capitalism \\\"out there\\\" vanished. The neo-liberal resurgence, which had seen extensive deregulation plus privatization of government monopolies in the 1980s, gathered momentum. Financial markets were freed up and privatization extended to core government functions like prisons and the military. Gated communities proliferated, spawning novel forms of private local government. Business took on new roles in developing counties as well, filling gaps in public service provision from weak states, and sometimes even reshaping political regimes themselves.",

The course is designed to deal with questions such as these: What is the global financial system and how does it work? What are the pressures on that system including market, regulatory, political, and social dynamics? What are the key challenges to that system? How can the system be strengthened? In this course we are defining the global financial system (GFS) as encompassing central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions such as asset managers and private equity firms, financial regulators, and international organizations. Thus the course encompasses subjects such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, Goldman Sachs and the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, the Carlyle Group and the BlackRock Investment Management Co., the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Financial Stability Board, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund. We take a broad view of the GFS including its history, geopolitical framework, economic foundations, and legal underpinnings. We consider the GFS as a critical public good in the same way that clean air is a public good. We look at a number of other key issues such as how the GFS deals with economic growth, economic and financial stability, distributional questions, employment issues, and long-term investments in infrastructure. We discuss how new technologies are affecting several of the biggest issues in global finance. We examine the GFS as a large-scale complex network, thereby compelling us to see it in an interconnected and multidisciplinary way.

Quarterly earnings, the 24hr news cycle, and social media blips command much of if not most attention. Yet the opportunity set facing business is overwhelmingly shaped by broad macro-trends and systemic risks – call them \\\"big issues.\\\" Climate change, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and urbanization are just some of the trends that will make some industries rise while others fall; challenge managers to reinvent their companies, products, and even themselves; and provide exciting opportunities for global leaders who are change agents and entrepreneurs. At the same time, because of business’s ability to adapt to and even steer major change, many stakeholders are looking to the business community to help solve global problems. To meet stakeholder expectations, and to ultimately convert global challenges into business opportunities, aspiring leaders must understand an array of issues that extend far beyond traditional business concerns. Only then can they create ‘shared value’ at the nexus of business and society. This course is designed to foster participants’ ability to think more holistically about globalization, global trends, and the role of business. It is structured around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of 17 objectives, backed up by 169 specific targets, that were adopted by the UN in 2015 after broad-based consultations involving governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academics, and the business community.\\\"",

This course helps you acquire basic accounting and finance knowledge that is extremely useful in the day-to-day practice of general management, consulting, investment banking—virtually any career path that you may pursue. Accounting systems provide important financial information for all types of organizations. Despite their many differences, all accounting systems are built on common foundations. Economic concepts, such as assets, liabilities, and income are used to organize information into a fairly standard set of financial information. Bookkeeping mechanics compile financial information with the double entry system of debits and credits. Accounting conventions help guide the application of the concepts through the mechanics. This course provides these fundamentals of accounting. The financial valuation part of the course helps students to understand the financial environment in which firms operate and the concepts that need to be mastered in order to make decisions that benefit the stakeholders of a typical organization. The time value of money and net present values and their application to the valuation of bonds and stocks, the trade-off of risk and return in financial markets, the computation of the cost of obtaining capital for investment, and how firms balance the use of equity and debt to finance their activities, are all topics to be considered in this class. The course has been specifically designed to provide the requisite fundamentals of accounting and valuation for students that do not currently have access to SOM’s core courses.

Global investment in financial assets, the need for risk diversification, the increased accuracy of property records, greater transparency, more relaxed laws permitting foreign investment, and population movement around the world—all of these trends have led to a tremendous increase in cross-border real estate investing for both private equity and public companies. While many studies of international real estate focus on the role of foreign real property in the U. S. institutional portfolio, this course will take a wider and more historical view of the cultural attitudes towards real estate around the world and how they impact the quality and risk of investment assets. Detailed analysis will begin with property level due diligence in order to provide a fundamental understanding of how and why property markets differ by country beyond simple supply/demand dynamics. This course will consist of three parts: a.) a micro-market analysis of real property characteristics in various countries around the world, including financing, leasing and valuation; b.) an analysis of investment vehicles—public and private—available to institutional investors, as well as cross-border transactions, and c.) a macro-market view of world space and capital markets, the rationale for international investing, trends in capital flows and portfolio composition and the various ways in which risk is measured and mitigated.

The course aims to be both a history of the interdisciplinary American Studies field and an exploration of newer debates, approaches, and frameworks that engage and revise earlier objects, areas, historical timelines, methods, and periods. Beyond the narratives of United States exceptionalism, we engage American Studies scholarship that considers U.S. culture, history, and politics in relation to the histories of slavery, settler colonialism, capitalism, race, gender, sexuality, subcultures, war and empire. To explore the various kinds of approaches and projects, the seminar features visits from Yale scholars. Students will read 100 pages of visiting scholars’ work and collaborate on topical and thematic questions for discussion. Assignments include brief weekly writing assignments. This course is mandatory for first-year American Studies graduate students.",
  "AFST 7719": "Missionary complicity with the colonial enterprise puts Christianity at the heart of the problematic relationship between the African continent and the West. At the same time, Christianity has continued to grow rapidly in post-independence Africa. In much of Africa south of the Sahara, decolonization efforts coincided with the period of the greatest Christian expansion in history. Africa is now the continent with the highest population of Christians. This course examines this conundrum through critical engagement with theory, literature, and data from the continent. Students examine historiographic, political, social, economic, and demographic dimensions of this discussion. They meet key theories posited with regard to African Christianity in the wake of a colonial history. The course surveys contemporary issues in the discourse within the urban, educational, social, and cultural spheres. Students also consider gender perspectives on coloniality as it pertains to religion and politics. The course assesses the role of indigenous agency in the development of Christianity within contemporary Africa. Through this course students will gain a more nuanced perspective as they examine and problematize critical arguments in the prevailing discourse on Christianity and coloniality in Africa today.

  "PLSC 3370": "Few societies have been as reliant on experts as our own. As societies grow more complex and technology advances, so does the need for experts who have undergone years of specialized training. Ordinary citizens, firms, state bureaucracies, courts, and legislators constantly rely on experts to guide them in their decisions. However, this reliance is far from seamless. Opportunities to become a successful expert are uneven and often depend on circumstances beyond individual control. Specialists must counter public skepticism and compete with rival groups to establish their authority. Decision-makers are inundated with claims to expertise, making it challenging to discern between valid and dubious advice. Experts can exacerbate issues, fail catastrophically, or neglect public concerns to serve their own interests. Moreover, the increasingly specialized knowledge possessed by experts can seem esoteric and detached from everyday life, leader laypeople to view them with suspicion. For these reasons and others, the very notion of expertise has become highly politicized in recent years. Our society seems to be more and more divided between those who think that experts are indispensable to solve our problems, and those who see them as the root of our troubles. The course adopts an interdisciplinary perspective to explore these issues, drawing from both classical and modern research in sociology, political science, psychology, and philosophy.",

Understanding the deep interconnections between race and law, and how race and law are co-constitutive, is the project of critical race theory. One of the central claims of critical race theory is that racial subordination is not a deviation from the liberal legal ideal but is, unfortunately, part of its expression. We focus on the origins of the critique that is central to the development of the theory and contrast its analysis with conventional analytic frameworks on race and American law and society. Because it is a positive theory but also driven by a normative vision, we explore the possibility of transforming the relationship between law and racial power. The law is not the only site of critical race theory; it has had a significant impact on other disciplines in the social sciences. We examine those impacts as well.",

Students are asked to analyze when and how sustainability leadership can translate into competitive advantage by helping to cut costs, reduce risk, drive growth, and promote brand identity and intangible value. The course seeks to provide students with an introduction to the range of sustainability issues and challenges that companies face in today’s fast-changing marketplace. It introduces key corporate sustainability terms, concepts, tools, strategies, and frameworks based on the overarching theory that the traditional profit-maximizing mission of business (often called shareholder primacy) is giving way to a new vision of stakeholder responsibility that still seeks to provide good returns to the enterprise’s owners but also acknowledges obligations to employees, suppliers, customers, communities, and society more broadly. The course combines lectures, case studies, and class discussions on management theory and tools, the legal and regulatory frameworks that shape the business-environment interface, and the evolving role of business in society. It explores how to deal with a world of diverse stakeholders, increasing transparency, and rising expectations related to corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance.

  "ENV 631": "This course explores the relationship between poverty, environment, and social inequality. It examines how race and class interact in American rural and urban environments to produce or sustain inequalities. The course examines how structural factors and community characteristics influence environmental outcomes. Students begin by examining the relationship between degraded environments and poor schooling. They examine the environmental hazards that exist in or adjacent to urban and rural public schools. Students will analyze inner-city and poor rural communities as they examine disinvestment, the concentration of poverty, efforts to disperse the poor, and the potential for community revitalization. Students examine homelessness and the ways in which climate disasters impact housing experiences. The course also examines another aspect of poverty: the issue of food security; it looks at the rise in community gardening in poor communities as an attempt to combat lack of access to healthy food. Students examine residential segregation and zoning and study the spatial inequalities that arise from the siting of hazardous facilities in minority and low-income urban and rural communities. The course examines the classic environmental justice question: which came first the facilities or the people? It examines economic questions related to costs of hosting noxious facilities and if and how communities can seek compensation to host such facilities. The course also examines the quandary communities face when presented with economic models that seek to provide compensation – the question of the long-term health of the people and environment takes center stage as community residents seek to determine how to balance economic development with concerns about sustainability. Students analyze water, energy, and climate justice.",

We see that market failure arises frequently in the context of environmental and natural resource management. The last part of the course focuses on the design of environmental and natural resource policies to address such market failures. The course is designed to cover basic knowledge of economics analysis and prepare students for ENV 834 and other more advanced offerings.",
  "ENV 762": "The language of mathematics is an important leg in the stool of interdisciplinary research and analysis, and many graduate courses at YSE involve mathematical content. However, many graduate students have not taken a math course in years, and their math skills are rusty. Furthermore, many graduate-level mathematical concepts may be entirely new. Experience suggests that many students either opt out of taking courses they are truly interested in or muddle through, struggle with the math, and miss important concepts. FAME is meant to help students refresh or acquire new math skills and succeed in content and provide a foundational \\\"toolbox\\\" for graduate-level courses. FAME provides a structured opportunity to learn a range of mathematical concepts used in environmental research. The course assumes that, at a minimum, students took college algebra (and have been exposed to calculus). Concepts are presented heuristically in a \\\"how to\\\" and \\\"why\\\" approach with examples from environmental research and policy questions. The goal is for students to be conversant and have intuition about (i.e., to demystify) why logs, exponents, derivatives, integrals.

  "ENV 695": "The Forest School continues its series on a history of forests, people and forestry. This fall series focuses on scientific forestry, from sustained yield to ecosystem management. The second part in this series explores the history of \\\"scientific forestry,\\\" tracing its origins in early-modern European views of nature, where scientific expertise was seen as a tool for dominion over the natural world and its colonial expansion. The course examines how European forestry practices influenced the development of forestry in the United States during the nineteenth century and how the profession gained ground in North American universities (including with the founding of the Yale Forest School in 1900). Focusing on the twentieth century, we trace the transformation of forestry from its early focus on protection and recovery of forests in the West to timber and sustained yield forest management particularly in the South and far West to the development of an ecosystem and ecological approach to managing our nation’s forests. Through this lens, we evaluate forestry in the United States by considering its successes and also its problematic legacies in relation to Native American dispossession and settler colonialism. From the Eastern United States in the colonial period to the upper Midwest and eventual expansion to the US South and Pacific Northwest in the early twentieth century, we follow the roots of land use and forestry and explore how the profession evolved with advances in modern genetics and ecosystem forestry, culminating in the watershed legislation of the 1970s, including NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Forest Management Act, which laid the foundation for a new era in forest management.",
  "ENV 682": "The basic premise of this course is that water is about power. Water problems around the world are not being experienced equally by different sectors of society but rather reflect—and exacerbate—underlying current and historical power asymmetries among different communities and identities. These inequalities are not limited to the issue of water rights (who gets how much water) but can be found across the whole range of water issues, from water quality to flooding to the impacts of dams. Likewise, these inequalities are reflected not just in the rules that determine water distribution, but also in the infrastructure, institutions, information, and incentives that form the basis of water management. This course explores the complex intersections of water access, equity, and environmental sustainability rights, and environmental justice. It examines historical and contemporary issues surrounding water distribution, policymaking, and the impact on marginalized communities. Through case studies and critical analysis, students engage with environmental justice, policymaking, and community action concepts, aiming to foster a deeper understanding of the need for equitable water distribution and governance in a changing climate.",

  "ENV 816": "The U.S. electric utility industry is a $400 billion business with capital expenditures on the order of $100 billion per year to replace aging infrastructure, implement new technologies, and meet new regulatory requirements. A reliable electricity infrastructure is essential for the U.S. economy and the health and safety of its citizens. The electric industry also has a significant impact on the environment. In the United States, electric power generation is responsible for about 40 percent of human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas. Electric utilities in the United States are at a crossroads. Technological innovations, improving economics, and regulatory incentives provide a transformational opportunity to implement demand-side resources and distributed energy technologies that will both lower emissions and improve service to customers. Such significant changes could, however, disrupt existing utility business models and therefore may not be fully supported by incumbent utilities. This course focuses on the issues, challenges, risks, and trade-offs associated with moving the U.S. utility industry toward a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. We explore how utilities are regulated and how economic factors and regulatory policies influence outcomes and opportunities to align customer, environmental, and utility shareholder interests to craft win-win-win solutions.",
  "ENV 692": "This course explores the science and practices of temperate agroforestry, covering current knowledge of agroforestry science and shedding light on the myths and assumptions that have yet to be tested regarding the integration of trees in agricultural systems. The course begins with an overview of modern agriculture to help us better understand why agroforestry systems have potential to improve the sustainability of farming systems. We also cover the social science regarding agroforestry and why it has not been widely adopted. Silvopasture and forest farming systems are the primary focus, but windbreaks, alley cropping, and riparian forest buffers are also covered. The field of agroforestry has struggled with the promotion of hypothetical practices; this course introduces students to real-world production agroforestry systems and helps them better contribute to financially viable and environmentally sound agricultural operations.",
  "ENV 764": "This course equips students to recognize and analyze how moral and cultural worldviews shape the way Americans understand nature, make policy, and define national purpose. Drawing on sociology, philosophy, and religious studies, students examine how sacred values guide decisions across sectors often seen as technical or rational, from environmental science to land management. The course centers the North American West—not as a regional niche but as a powerful lens for understanding how American belief systems collide, adapt, and endure. We trace these dynamics through public land conflicts, ecotourism, spiritual movements, unlikely forms of cooperation, and cultural responses to death and extinction. Students learn to analyze cultural systems, write persuasively, build confidence speaking, and engage across political and moral divides with nuance and clarity. Don’t take this course if you’re not ready to do heavy reading, challenge your assumptions, and engage in open debate.",

  "ART 5470": "This seminar invokes the art of ventriloquism as a lens through which to engage contemporary painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking, architecture, video, installation, and interdisciplinary practice. Engaging with issues of voice, embodiment, power, and projection, the case studies in this course both examine and enact ventriloqual practices, and do so as a means of interrogating and performatively bearing out contemporary conceptions of authorship, subjectivity, and performance. With historical roots in religious and spiritual practices dating to antiquity, ventriloquism became popular as a theatrical practice in the nineteenth century, with stage performers who gained notoriety for their ability to \\\"throw\\\" their voices onto the bodies of artificial dummies, puppets, and marionettes. Although theoretically outmoded by recording technologies that make possible more seamless practices of voice-throwing, dubbing, and other visual and sonic manipulations, ventriloquism remains alive and well as a strategy within contemporary art and art history, already having been highlighted by artists dating back to Paul Klee and Jasper Johns. The case studies in this contemporary art seminar in oscillate seamlessly between art history, theory, and criticism through both analytical and performative means. This class shines light on what may seem an outdated practice, repositioning it as a conspicuous and meaningful trend within a range of artistic practices today. Artists to be examined include: Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla, Candice Breitz, Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller, Antoine Catala, Mel Chin, Anne Chu, Catherine Clover, Nina Elder, María Consuelo García, Gilbert and George, Guerilla Girls, Ann Hamilton, Sharon Hayes, Pablo Helguera, Pierre Huyghe, Christian Jankowski, Isaac Julien, Tadeusz Kantor, Mike Kelley, William Kentridge, Glenn Ligon, Kerry James Marshall, Courtney McClellan, Juan Muñoz, Bruce Nauman, Philippe Parreno, Wael Shawky, Lorna Simpson, Anna Deveare Smith, Henry Taylor, Kara Walker, Nora Wendl, Jordan Wolfson, and more. Finally, we will consider exhibitions that have literally and metaphorically invoked this theme, such as, for example, José Blondet’s Not I: Throwing Voices (1500 BCE–2020CE), staged at LACMA in 2018 and Ingrid Schaffner’s Puppet Show which toured in 2008 and beyond.

The Tutor (ILCE Practicum Elective participant) meets with a group of 4 students (combination of PA and MD ) over the course of 9 months (September-March) for a total of 14 sessions of 2 hours each. Tutors will be in a group of at least 2, and thus would only need to meet with the students for 7 sessions in the ED. These sessions are either on Monday or Friday (based on tutor preference), in the afternoon (any time starting at 1pm but ending by 6pm). Tutors will find 2-4 patients for the students to interview, and later in the course, do a limited physical while you observe and give them feedback. The Tutor will identify patients that are willing and able to have students interview them to obtain a history and then examine them. For the first half of the course, the students focus on accurate and thorough history-gathering. During the second half of the course (after December), the physical exam is added. Formative feedback will be offered throughout the experience. The students present the case to the facilitator and the rest of the group will observe the teaching and will offer feedback and help them hone their presentation skills. The group begins to generate a differential diagnosis and work-up plan with input from each student and the tutor. Direct observation is expected to aide in learning and offer feedback. Thus, facilitators should not be working clinically while they are teaching. Consequently, the facilitator will advise the scheduler to protect their schedule from clinical obligations when they are scheduled to meet with students. The facilitator will also verify that the students are aware of patient privacy regulations (HIPAA, etc.) and to lead debriefs in locations that can ensure privacy. All paper records that include HIPAA-sensitive information (e.g. EKGs, Lab result print-outs, etc) will be disposed of in appropriate receptacles and will NEVER leave the clinical, patient-care environments. Meetings with the Faculty Elective Director: The Tutor will meet with the Faculty Elective Director three times during the elective: The dates of these sessions should be decided on and scheduled before end of September. The first should be on second meeting with the students. The last should be close to the end of the course. The first two meetings will involved the faculty director direct observation of the tutor’s interaction with the students. The third meeting will include: 1) Debriefing on the entire course 2) Discussion of tutor’s final written report 3) Student feedback given to tutor throughout the course 4) Final student feedback given via Qualtrics Permission of the instructor required.",

  "ARCH 6113": "This course examines the human relationship to mechanized perception in art and architecture. Mechanical eyes, such as satellites, rovers, computer vision, and autonomous sensing devices, give us unprecedented access to nonhuman and superhuman views into known and unknown environments. But the technology of automatic observation alienates human observers and fools them into thinking that this is an unemotional, inhuman point of view due to its existence in a numeric or digital domain. The observer is looking at seemingly trustworthy data that has been \\\"flattened\\\" or distilled from the real world. But this face-value acceptance should be rejected; interpreters of this device data should interrogate the motives, biases, or perspectives informing the \\\"artist\\\" in this case (that is, the developer/programmer/engineer who created the devices). Despite the displacement of direct human observation, mechanical eyes present in remote sensing, LiDAR scanning, trail-cams, metagenomic sequencing, urban informatics, and hyperspectral imaging have become fundamental to spatial analysis. But as these become standard practice, observers should also be trained in cracking open the data to understand the human perspective that originally informed it. In this class, students investigate the impact of the mechanical eye on cultural and aesthetic inquiry into a specific site. They conceptually consider their role as interpreter for the machine and create a series of site analysis experiments across a range of mediums. The experiments are based on themes of inversion, mirroring, portraiture, memory, calibration, and foregrounding to \\\"unflatten\\\" data into structure and form. Limited enrollment.",

The seminar is project-based, and students will undertake an architectural reconstruction project of their own – developed each week and engaged with themes from each unit.",
  "ARCH 7124": "Architects have explored the topic of disability and human impairment well before and beyond contemporary practices of \\\"accessible design.\\\" This seminar examines histories of architecture, disability, and human impairment through a range of case-studies from 1900 to the present. We will understand how disability transformed (and was transformed by) the practices of modern and late-modern architects and designers – from early 20th century theories of design to recent debates on the aesthetic character of urban monuments. To explore these histories, we will draw on an interdisciplinary range of readings, documents, films, and physical artifacts. The course will include a mix of lectures and discussion, guest presentations, and the development of a final research project related to the course case-studies and readings.",
  "ARCH 7104": "How has design shaped the rise of global capitalism, c.1700 to present? Surveying a wide range of buildings, objects, infrastructures, and landscapes across the Atlantic World, our aim is to understand how the built environment evolved to guide practices of capital accumulation—from the plantations of the early modern Caribbean to the \\\"supertalls\\\" of Billionaires’ Row. Readings draw from a growing body of scholarly literature that approaches design as an agent of political economy as opposed to a reflection of pre-existing ideas and economic structures. The seminar’s case studies therefore emphasize the reciprocity between themes of architectural and capitalist modernity (e.g., Circulation, Development) as well as the spatial forms and extractive processes that accompany them. Course work results in new critical perspectives for the historical study of present-day spatial inequality. Moreover, moving beyond familiar narratives and geographies of modernity, we will consider design’s relation to not only the production of wealth, but also counter-models of local autonomy, mutual aid, and redistribution.",

An introduction to the analysis and design of building structural systems and the evolution and impact of these systems on architectural form. Lectures and homework assignments cover structural classifications, fundamental principles of mechanics, computational methods, and the behavior and case studies of truss, cable, arch, and simple framework systems. Discussion sections explore the applications of structural theory to the design of wood and steel systems for gravity loads through laboratory and computational exercises and design projects. Homework, design projects, and midterm and final examinations are required.",
  "ARCH 7105": "If we are to rethink architecture now, as we must, we need also to rethink its relations to computation. In homage to Tony Vidler’s \\\"Architecture Dismembered\\\", this seminar examines the historic, and now uncanny, doubling of architecture with not the body but with the long and inevitable project of computation, itself ironically a project to de-corporealize thought and render it automatic. In the sessions we consider the ideations of architecture and computation as ever-entangled, if not co-constitutive, arguing, tout court, that without architectural imagination the computer would not be the same, and vice versa. A historiographic dismembering of the architect’s various discrete (and indiscreet) machines reveals shared: memory storage and retrieval systems; mechanisms for deletion and forgetting; windows, guns, pens, nozzles; universal languages, algorithms and other compressive strategies in the calculation of true products; taming of chance by prediction. Like Humpty Dumpty, once apart, they will not go back together again and thus complicate beyond retrieval the already waning platitudes of optimisation and digital solutionism. Instead they suggest potential new categories with which to mutually reconstitute architecture’s relations to computation: the appetite; the mediocre; the alienated; the duped and the promise of the automatic.",

To revamp semiotics’ main tasks, after an introduction about the idea of \\\"making meaning,\\\" the seminar engages students in a weekly discussion about situations, procedures, objects, and attributes that are \\\"meaningful,\\\" in the double sense that they have meaning and they arrange reality in a meaningful way. Objects of analysis are intentionally disparate; the constant application of a set of analytical tools provides the coherence of the seminar. Students are expected to regularly attend the seminar, actively participate in discussions, propose new objects of analysis, present a case study (fifteen–twenty minutes), and write a final paper (max. 5,000 words).

  "ARCH 5115": "This course is an investigation of the ways technology, which now mediates data through spatial computing platforms such as extended reality (XR), will continue to impact our relationship with the built environment and the architect’s role in the development of these new digital horizons. Our exploration in XR includes a special guest instructor, Olalekan Jeyifous, a visual artist whose work explores visions of the future as a critique of contemporary social structures though the creation of dystopian realities describing urban issues, politics, art, and popular culture as expressions of the black diaspora within the disappearing urban ephemera of places like Brooklyn, New York, where his practice is based. Together, we explore the existing urban condition as an environment co-constitutive of other realities such as social structures, institutionalized injustice, and prevailing false narratives expressed as imagined futures in the form of non-static immersive experiences of the city. These imagined futures reveal the thin line between hope and despair as expressions of uncomfortable truths about the current trajectories of society.",
  "ARCH 7123": "Although the built environment shapes multi-sensory experience, Western architects since antiquity have upheld the mind/body split, framing architecture as a medium primarily apprehended through vision and hearing—senses historically associated with male reason, abstract thinking, and the scientific method. Meanwhile, they have marginalized the so-called \\\"lower\\\" senses—touch, taste, and smell—linked to the abject physical body and the material world. And while buildings are constructed from solid materials extracted from the natural environment, architects have largely ignored the haptic sensations elicited when corporeal beings engage with the material world, considered a female principle, associated with Mother Earth. This course challenges these problematic assumptions by situating them in a techno-historical context. We will examine the intertwined histories of architecture and sensory-enhancing technologies that privilege seeing and hearing—from the Renaissance camera obscura to 20th-century glass curtain walls to 21st-century smartphones. These technologies have shaped both the design of built environments and our sensory experience of space in ways that reinforce the mind/body split and exclude those who do not conform to able-bodied norms. Critically examining these techno-sensory developments through the lens of gender and disability will allow us to propose alternative futures. How can we learn from the experiences of people with physical and sensory disabilities, as well as from ethnic and religious communities whose engagement with the built environment draws on different senses, faculties, and customs? How can we harness technological innovations that augment sensory perception to design immersive, inclusive environments—spaces that promote meaningful human interaction among people with diverse embodied identities as they navigate both virtual and physical realms? *",
  "ARCH 5110": "This course will be offered to graduate and undergraduate students who wish to pursue their own special talents, follow their passions, and expand possibilities and creative impulses to create a small object of their own design. The course is cross-listed with Architecture, Neuroscience, and Engineering & Applied Science (SEAS) and will intentionally bring together students with different backgrounds and experiences. The course explores the ideation, design processes, and fabrication of a functioning prototype. A \\\"small object\\\" is defined as something that is able to fit comfortably through a standard doorway. Potential areas of exploration include, but are not limited to: jewelry, furniture, experimental scientific instruments, electronic devices, architectural objects, lighting, cutlery, packaging, and musical instruments. Student selection is competitive and through application only. Proposal submissions are due by Aug. 18 (mid-night), with preference given to graduate students in Architecture, Neuroscience, and SEAS. Previous experience building your small object is not required. Passion for your object—and for building it—are critical for a successful proposal and for success in the course. (Example proposals will be provided with course description material.) Each student will be able to follow their own path as they acquire professional-level competencies in designing and creating their small object, with an understanding that design disciplines are increasingly expanding and converging. As such, students will be encouraged to explore as many university resources as possible to achieve the desired outcome. The methodology used to complete tasks in this course will give students an understanding of a typical industrial design process while equipping them with skills, concepts, and tools used to create scientific-grade instrumentation. The course will encourage creative and scientific exploration, while fostering an interdisciplinary nexus for fabrication technology, design pedagogy, and problem-solving. While each student will pursue an individual project, true innovation often results from cross-pollination between disciplines. To facilitate interdisciplinary interaction and expand possibility, students from different disciplines will work together as they explore the development and fabrication of their small object. Weekly reviews will be coupled with training and seminars. Students will also have access to multiple state-of-the-art design and fabrication facilities that include manual and computer-controlled manufacturing machines, electronic equipment, rapid prototyping tools, and computer aided drafting (CAD) and rendering programs. Students will be exposed to design drawing techniques, physical modeling methods, and the concept of designing for manufacture. Students will acquire professional-level competence in two- and three-dimensional design—using aesthetic sensibility, digital/analog tools, and critical thinking—combined with a working knowledge of materials and methods in an environmentally responsible context. The course will be structured around teaching modules, studio time, and critique periods. During class sessions, students will be encouraged to actively engage in critiquing their fellow students’ work. Technique workshops covering different project-related types of fabrication will be held during the second half of the semester. Enrollment is limited to no more than 9 students.",
  "ARCH 6102": "This seminar flips the traditional approach to architectural education by focusing not on celebrated successes, but on failures – spectacular, sobering, and instructive. Through detailed case studies of structural and architectural disasters, the course examines how miscalculations, human error, design flaws, mismanagement, and unforeseen conditions can lead to catastrophic outcomes. More than a technical postmortem, these failures are also considered within their broader political, cultural, environmental, and professional contexts. What went wrong? Why did it happen? What were the consequences—not just for the buildings themselves, but for the people who used, built, and designed them? The course also looks at how these failures have prompted changes in building codes, engineering standards, professional ethics, and architectural practice. By studying what did not work, students gain critical insight into what it means to build responsibly, learning to anticipate risk, question assumptions, and navigate the complex realities of the practice of architecture. Each student selects a building failure to research and presents their findings in class. Through this process, the course aims to develop more thoughtful, critical, and ethically grounded designers – aware not only of how things are built, but of how things can go wrong.",
  "ARCH 7115": "This seminar investigates the many architectures that participate in state and racial formation. That is, how spatial constructions—including infrastructure, housing, borders, segregation, taxation, and policing—supported by the state are integral to processes of racial hierarchization and how racialized subjects are managed and controlled. The seminar focuses on the American context, but the definition of American boundaries is open to interpretation and contestation. We look at American expansion and political history to see how inequalities have been historically constructed and how they continue to persist. We analyze American internal and external imperialism, militarism, and securitization to better understand how the nation’s myriad spatial entanglements structure life and social relations. The seminar reads a broad set of texts including Madison, Locke, Aimé Césaire, Frantz Fanon, Cedric J. Robinson, Katherine McKittrick, Sylvia Wynter, Michael Omi and Howard Winant, Cheryl I. Harris, Aileen Moreton-Robinson, and others. We engage with current discourses on race and architecture and link them to discussions on media, politics, and the contested project of the American nation.

  "ARCH 5103": "Climate change disproportionately affects the people and places with the least power and resources. As our sea levels have risen, so too has the extreme socioeconomic disparity of specific communities and countries, creating a drowning class of climate refugees. Entire countries on the front lines of sea-level rise face the specter of nationhood without territory, despite the undeniable fact that their contribution to this global problem is negligible. And if climate change is in fact \\\"the result of human activity since the mid-20th century,\\\" it is in actuality a largely male-made phenomenon, if we unpack the gender dynamics and underlying power structures of the proto-G8 nations, the self-proclaimed leaders of industrialization. These power dynamics become even further exacerbated as we consider the implications of the particularly American interest in doubling down on investing in the heaviest piece of infrastructure ever—climate engineering. The architectural community appears to be in agreement. Climate change is a fundamental design problem. And yet calls to action have been ineffectual, responses underwhelming in the face of this overwhelming challenge. As the architectural community is eagerly poised to jump on the design bandwagon, this course seeks to reveal, foreground, empower, and give physical form to the spatial dimensions and power dynamics of the people and places most impacted by climate change. More broadly, the course aspires to help students develop their own critical stance on climate change and the role architects play.",

Working in teams directly with local community-based non-profits, students will co-create detailed development proposals anchored by affordable housing, but which also engage with a range of community development issues including environmental justice, sustainability, resilience, social equity, identity, food scarcity, mobility, and health. Through seminars and workshops with Yale faculty and guest practitioners in the field, students will be introduced to the history, theory, issues, and contemporary practices in this field, and will get direct feedback on their work. Offered in partnership with the Connecticut Department of Housing (DOH) as part of the Connecticut Plan for Healthy Cities, proposals will have the opportunity to receive funding from the State both towards the implementation of rapidly deployed pilot projects during the course period, as well as towards predevelopment activities for larger projects, such as housing rehabilitation or new building construction.

  "ARCH 7129": "Recent surges in the last 500 years of colonizing, capitalizing, and globalizing may be more treacherous and untraceable than those of previous empires. This course exposes their infrastructures. While it begins with the global colonial extraction networks, most of the material circles around the spatial apparatus deployed toward the end of the 20th century that accompanied what is often amnesically referred to as \\\"globalization.\\\" This infrastructure is not only the infrastructure of pipes and wires underground but also the ubiquitous enveloping urban medium of repeatable formulas for space—a human/nonhuman socio-technical space that is rapidly producing a new layer of the earth’s crust. Critiqued by both the left and the populist right this massive physical plant contains a spectrum of dangers: capitalism, fascism, racism, whiteness, settler colonialism, femicide, caste, xenophobia, psychotic leadership, and countless other ways of hoarding power, abusing people, and damaging the planet. The story resists and exceeds any easy ideological explanations or definitions of the neoliberalism with which this moment is associated–a moment when, not rational actors and nation states, but an often irrational extrastatecraft, deploys stealthy, bullet-proof forms of power. Discussion is interspersed with heavily illustrated talks that encounter: instant free zone world cities, satellite urbanism and broadband from the perspective of Non-Aligned countries in South Asia and Africa, labor, conflict, and climate migration, an agripole in Southern Spain, automated ports, islands and offshore financial centers as the confetti of multiple empires, contagious spatial products of commerce and tourism, a cruise ship to the DPRK, the standards and management platforms of ISO, sweatshops, tax havens, and exploding urban peripheries among many other things. Going beyond the anointed legal, scientific, and econometric languages, the seminar also uncovers forms of spatially-embedded activism to meet this moment. The evidence returns to moments of worldmaking solidarity within newly independent colonies in the Global South—solidarities between the Pan-African, Non-Aligned, Tricontinental, and civil rights movements that the Global North broke by further tilting the playing fields in their own favor. And the seminar considers the infrastructures that dominant infrastructures eclipsed—live infrastructures of land, water, atmosphere, and community—to be as worthy of public support as infrastructures of concrete and conduit. As reparations for patterns of harm that will otherwise only continue, these alternative infrastructures are inextricably linked to climate change and planetary concerns. If the global conjures associations with White Enlightenment modern universals, singular evils and singular solutions, planetary conjures the patchy, partial, multiple approaches in the pluriverse. Treating everyone as a designer, the course is an adventure in thinking as well as a mixing chamber for disciplines across the university: social sciences, arts, economics, business history, science and technology studies, history of science, organization studies, informatics, media and communication studies, architecture and urbanism. Cultural ephemera is screened as a prelude to each lecture. Weekly readings offer evidence, discursive commentary, and critique. Tutorials help to shape group work.",

Among the various technologies involved, emphasis is placed on structural and facade systems, recognizing the significance of these systems, the separation of which in terms of their function led to modern architecture and allowed the emergence of tall buildings. This seminar reviews contemporary design practice of tall buildings through a series of lectures and case study analyses. While most representative technologies for tall buildings are studied, particular emphasis is placed on more recent trends such as diagrid structures and double-skin facades. Further, this seminar investigates emerging technologies for tall buildings and explores their architectural potentials. Finally, this course culminates in a tall building design project and presentation. Limited enrollment.",
  "ARCH 5116": "Architectural ruins index the total failure of individual buildings, technologies, economies, or, at times, entire civilizations. This course researches the topics of ruination and architectural ruins—what produces them, what defines them, and how they impact individuals, cities, and civilizations on levels from the visual and formal to the philosophical and psychological. The formal and visual materials of this course emerge from the study of ruins from not only the past and present, but also the future, through research into the speculative territories of online \\\"ruin porn,\\\" new genres of art practice, and in particular dystopian television and film projects that reveal an intense contemporary cultural interest in apocalyptic themes. While significant nineteenth-century theories of architectural ruination, including those of John Ruskin (anti-restoration) and Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (pro-restoration), are addressed, the primary intellectual position of the course emerges from readings and discussions of the philosophical methodology of \\\"ruination.\\\" Student projects involve the philosophical and aesthetic ruination of iconic architectural projects to determine not only their essential qualities, but hidden, latent ones as well. Subsequent group discussion of this work vacillates between philosophical and aesthetic poles in an attempt to tease out new observations on these projects as well as on the nature of ruins and ruination. The self-designed final project is determined pending consultation between the students and instructor, but involves photorealistic failure of past, present, or future architectural or urban projects; dystopic visual speculations; fabrication experiments that test actual material decay and failure; or attempts to reproduce the aesthetic ambitions of ruin porn through the manipulation of existing, or the design of new, projects. The goal of the course is not to convey an existing body of architectural knowledge, but to unearth a new architectural discourse that considers architecture in reverse—emphasizing its decay rather than its creation in an effort to reveal new territories of architectural agency.

  "ARCH 7108": "The notion of play occupies a special place in the history of modern art and architecture. Theorized in the 19th century by Friedrich Froebel as fundamental to the process by which children learn, play would form the basis of Froebel’s kindergarten, now a model for early childhood education worldwide. The aesthetic intensity of Froebel’s program would likewise contribute to a variety of radical educational projects in the 19th and 20th centuries, including the Bauhaus. Later, Johan Huizinga’s seminal meditation on the \\\"play element in culture,\\\" Homo Ludens, would provide an intellectual foundation for a number of 20th century aesthetic and political movements, among them the Situationist International. Finally, a generous focus on play has recently reemerged within the discourse on a range of 21st century art and design practices, characterized by a shared focus on participation and performativity, as in the work of Rirkrit Tiravanija and Lottie Child. This course, then, explores the place and problem of play in three ways: as a critical framework for understanding the aesthetic qualities of the human environment; as a mode of experience, giving meaning to that environment; and as a working method employed by artists and architects as a specific form of practice.",
  "ARCH 5109": "Course Introduction Ink proposes a creative and critical inquiry into ink’s instrumentality in architecture to delineate a subtle story—a latent history of architecture in ink—placing ink in our world with the purpose of gaining knowledge within and for the architectural discipline. A close consideration of the varied conceptual and material aspects of ink acts as a medium to reflect upon the means by which architectural knowledge is generated, articulated, and applied. Course Structure The course will be structured by the abecedary, ink or \\\"V is for Vermilion as described by Vitruvius\\\" An A to Z of Ink in Architecture. Composed from various material forms of ink found in studio, an alphabet in 26 images was created and sent as an invitation to 26+ architects, artists, historians, theorists, scholars, inventors and poets to write a brief entry on a discrete ink object. On the first day of class, 13 of the 26 letters will be selected at random and a single letter assigned to each week of the course. Each week, the class will closely examine the ink objects described by diverse voices in the entries written under the assigned letter— conceptually and materially—by reading, in discussion and in drawings. Reading: Each entry describing a discrete ink object is typically brief—generally 500 to 1000 words; the 26 letters contain between 1-5 entries each on average. Weekly reading will be assigned by letter to be discussed in class. Discussion: Each week the class will discuss the ink entries under a single letter to create collective word images. Drawing (in-class/in-studio): Students will spend time each class period using drawing to explore material and conceptual aspects of the ink objects. [These drawings may provide material for the weekly out-of-class assignments. Students will keep a folio of A3 loose-leaf sheets that can be pinned up and compiled for reference and review. In addition, there may be collective in-class drawings, done on larger paper that will be in response to discussion in class. They will be due at the end of the class period. Supplemental ink materials may be provided by the instructor.] Drawing (out-of-class assignments): Students will construct an architectural drawing(s) each week for the letter discussed in class, due at the beginning of the next class (for pin-up/discussion). [Students will determine four parameters for each architectural drawing: scale (ie. measured drawing), view (ie. projection: parallel, oblique, orthographic, isometric, perspective), set (format), and sequence. These architectural drawings may be manual and/or digital. The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscripts Library, a container formed of ink that contains ink, will form the basis of these drawings.] Pin-ups: Weekly drawing assignments will be reviewed weekly. Before each week’s discussion, you should pin-up with the rest of your studio group to facilitate an efficient discussion. Reviews: For Mid review, architectural drawing of a single entry from ink by the student’s choice (not covered in the 13 assigned letters) will be constructed. For Final review, students may delineate a new entry for the abecedary, ink. Mid and Final reviews will include outside critics. Evaluation: Each drawing assignment will be evaluated for a) technique and b) completion. After each pin-up and during the in-class exercise the professor will give an evaluation that will then be recorded by the TF. If a drawing needs improvement to satisfactorily meet the requirements of the assignment, the student will be asked to make these improvements for re-evaluation. All assignments must meet this standard to successfully pass the course. Course Requirements Attendance at all class sessions is mandatory, in accordance with YSoA policy. More than two unexcused absences constitute failure of the class. Out-of-class drawing assignments must be completed by 6pm on the Thursday before the date they are reviewed. Drawings are to be saved for comprehensive review at the end of the term and submitted digitally as directed by the Teaching Fellow.",

Leaving aside demands of program and site in order to concentrate on formal relationships and the impact of alternative strategies, these exercises are intended to develop techniques by which words, briefs, written descriptions, intentions, and requirements can be translated into three dimensions. Each subject is introduced by a one-hour lecture on organizational paradigms in works of architecture from many periods and a variety of cultures. The medium is both physical and 3-D digital models.

  "ARCH 6105": "How do we make design a more profitable practice? Design business has traditionally positioned building as a commodity in the delivery supply chain, valued by clients like other products and services purchased at lowest first cost. Despite the fact that the building sector in its entirety operates in large capital pools where significant value is created, intense market competition, sole focus on differentiation by design quality, and lack of innovation in project delivery and business models have resulted in a profession that is grossly underpaid and marginally profitable. The profession must explore new techniques for correlating the real value of an architect’s services to clients and thereby break the downward pressure on design compensation. This seminar redesigns the value proposition of architecture practice, explores strategies used by better-compensated adjacent professions and markets, and investigates methods by which architects can deliver—and be paid for—the value they bring to the building industry.

  "ARCH 6101": "Current sustainability discourse labels many existing buildings as ‘bad.’ Hooked on fossil fuels, leaky and inefficient, existing buildings are penalized for their carbon footprint by cities and policymakers to provoke energy renovations and upgrades. New, ‘Net Zero Carbon’ buildings have been the sustainability focus of the AEC industry – all-electric, highly efficient, technologically advanced, these ground up buildings have been heralded as climate saviors. This seminar presents the opposite as true: new, ‘Net Zero’ buildings are a distraction, not our salvation. It is the existing ‘bad’ buildings, the messy fabric all around us, that do pose a carbon challenge, but also hold a profound solution to achieving a low carbon future. All new buildings, regardless of their operational carbon efficiency, release over half of their lifetime emissions during construction as embodied carbon. As we try to reduce emissions now to limit warming to 2°C, the focus of the architecture community must turn to what is already built around us. And we have inherited an urban fabric of ‘bad buildings,’ with old envelopes, outdated fossil fuel-based mechanical systems, and complicated equipment built over decades. Upgrading these buildings to be more carbon efficient is essential, but it is expensive, messy, and thankless work. Building owners must be able to extract value from this type of significant capital investment: they won’t decarbonize a building without a value proposition, change in program, market target, or commercial offering. The essential and urgent task of decarbonizing existing buildings presents both architectural challenges and carbon opportunities, and the truth is that no one has figured out how to make it happen yet. In pursuit of new solutions grounded in practice, this seminar will follow two tracks: the technical and theoretical. The technical side will cover reuse (embodied carbon) and retrofit (operational carbon) through lectures, guest speakers, and short assignments. The theoretical track will cover case studies and readings on adaptive reuse and architectural proposition. The seminar will culminate with studentinitiated proposals for decarbonizing and reinventing an existing building in New York City.",

  "ARCH 7121": "From the beginning of the twentieth century to the present, urbanization has gradually come to dominate political, economic, social, and cultural landscapes of the contemporary world. To be urban was to be modern, and the development of modern social theory relied on using the city as its research laboratory. Two decades into the twenty-first century, features of urbanization such as density, resource extraction, environmental degradation, and intense social inequalities appear to be ubiquitous across different geopolitical conditions. This course presents students with a range of theories that attempt to make sense of the variegated and intersecting conditions that define contemporary urban localities. Building on the understanding offered by these theories, we conclude with an exploration of emerging positions, concepts, and propositions that enable new ways of understanding the centrality of urbanism within a world dominated by uncertainty, speculation, and dystopia.",

  "HPM 631": "This is a case-based course about innovation and entrepreneurship for health equity and drivers of health. Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This requires addressing obstacles to health such as poverty, racism, gender and other biases and their consequences, including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay, quality education and housing, healthy foods, safe environments, and health care. We refer to these as drivers of health. The cases in this course bring to light the complexities in drivers of health, and the role of entrepreneurship and cross-sectoral collaboration in eliminating health disparities. Class discussions are aimed at providing students with experience in understanding potential benefits and pitfalls of applying public health entrepreneurship to improve health equity and drivers of health. We examine cases of entrepreneurship for health equity in the U.S. and globally, using a research-based framework to analyze the role of design justice, resource mobilization, financial viability, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and systems strengthening. Cases include start-ups and new ventures within existing institutions, referred to as intrapreneurship. We also examine cases of collective impact, or innovating across multiple institutions. Over the years, students in this class have began referring to these as extrapreneurship. This course brings together students from the Schools of Management, Public Health, Environment, Global Affairs, Divinity, Engineering, Arts and Sciences, and undergraduates.",
  "EMD 568": "This course explores infectious disease epidemiology and public health practice in a world that has been transformed by human influence on the biosphere. The course is divided into three modules, focused on: (1) the role of anthropogenic environmental change in the process of zoonotic and vector-borne disease emergence, including new epidemic and pandemic threats; (2) the effects of climate change on infectious disease dynamics in humans and animals; and (3) levers for intervention to curb environmental drivers of disease risk or reduce their impact on human health and health systems. A primary aim of this course is to expose students to different frameworks for study design and causal inference, including approaches from epidemiology, ecology, econometrics, and anthropology.",
  "EMD 538": "This course provides an overview of statistical and analytical methods that apply specifically to infectious diseases. The assumption of independent outcomes among individuals that underlies most traditional statistical methods often does not apply to infections that can be transmitted from person to person. Therefore, novel methods are often needed to address the unique challenges posed by infectious disease data. Topics include analysis of outbreak data, estimation of vaccine efficacy, time series methods, and Markov models. The course consists of lectures and computer labs in which students gain experience analyzing example problems using a flexible computer programming language (MATLAB)."
