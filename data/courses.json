However, these foreigner-authored fantasies have often overshadowed the lived experience and life storytelling of Caribbean subjects. This course explores the intersecting performance cultures, politics, and sensual/sexual practices that have constituted queer life in the Caribbean region and its diaspora. Placing Caribbean queer of color critique alongside key moments in twentieth and twenty-first century performance history at home and abroad, we ask how have histories of the plantation, discourses of race and nation, migration, and revolution led to the formation of regionally specific queer identifications. What about the idea of the \"tropics\" has made it such as fertile ground for queer performance making, and how have artists from the region identified or dis-identified with these aesthetic formations? This class begins with an exploration of theories of queer diaspora and queer of color critique’s roots in black feminisms. We cover themes of exile, religious rites, and organizing as sights of queer political formation and creative community in the Caribbean.",

Its second half turns to the late twentieth and twenty-first century criticism of legendary arts journalists, scholars and critics: Toni Morrison, Thulani Davis, Margo Jefferson, Hilton Als, Greg Tate, Farah J.

Rather than interpret black feminist theory as a critical formation that simply puts race, gender, sexuality, and class into conversation with one another, the course apprehends that formation as one that produced epistemic shifts in how we understand politics, empire, history, the law, and literature. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the areas into which black feminism intervened. It is merely a sample of some of the most vibrant ideological and discursive contexts in which black feminism caused certain epistemic transformations.",

Starting with pre-revolutionary writing, including the emergence of Haitian Creole letters, moving through a long, largely francophone nineteenth century, to present-day Haitian writing in the English language, this two-semester exploration of Haitian literature presents the political, cultural, and historical frameworks necessary to comprehend Haiti's vast literary output. Whether writing in Haiti or its wide-ranging diasporas, Haitian authors have boldly contributed to pressing conversations in global letters while reflecting Haiti's unique cultural and historical experiences. Considering an expansive array of poets, playwrights, and novelists - such as Baron de Vastey, Juste Chanlatte, Demesvar Delorme, Edwidge Danticat, René Depestre, Kettly Mars, Dany Laferrière, and Évelyne Trouillot – this course engages students in a fresh examination of Haiti’s richly polyglot and transnational literary tradition that spans more than two centuries.",

But, we also look closely at the richness of love and intimacy, the radical roots of self-fashioning, and the insurgent potentiality of mobility and aesthetic creativity coursing through the lives of her protagonists who cut a fugitive path out of slavery, ride the waves of Reconstruction, the Great Migration, Civil Rights era hope and organizing, and post-Soul searching. We read key scholarship in direct conversation with Morrison’s oeuvre, and we examine her robust and demanding critical essays on American literature, on contemporary events, and on the topic of writing.",

A second-generation Jamaican/Panamanian immigrant, Jordan was an award-winning poet and essayist whose poetry, nonfiction, fiction, and drama reflected her urgent analyses of domestic and foreign politics. And despite Jordan’s prolific output—she published 28 works in her lifetime—criticism has lagged behind her achievement. This course engages a deep study of Jordan’s body of work. Seeking to understand Jordan’s writings in the context of the major social and political upheavals of the century, we analyze Jordan’s poetics of resistance—her manipulation of meter and voice to make her work responsive to social movements around the world, from the United States to Central American to the Occupied Palestinian Territories—across genres.

The course investigates how the silencing of colonial history has been made possible culturally and ideologically, and how this silencing has in turn been central to the reorganizing of French culture and society from the period of decolonization to the present. We ask how racial regimes and spaces have been constructed in French colonial discourses and how these constructions have evolved in postcolonial France. We examine postcolonial African diasporic literary writings, films, and other cultural productions that have explored the complex relations between race, colonialism, historical silences, republican universalism, and color-blindness. Topics include the 1931 Colonial Exposition, Black Paris, decolonization, universalism, the Trente Glorieuses, the Paris massacre of 1961, anti-racist movements, the \"beur\" author, memory, the 2005 riots, and contemporary afro-feminist and decolonial movements.",

In this course we examine the reverberations of anticolonial movements in Portuguese-speaking African and Asian territories, as well as in Indigenous movements in Brazil. Focusing on political, social, and cultural dimensions of emancipation, we ask: How have African, Asian, and Indigenous writers and artists imagined emancipatory endeavors for their peoples, their countries, and their worlds? What is the role of cultural expression in world-sharing and world-building in response to centuries of colonialism and its legacies? This course also aims to further develop communicative proficiency in Portuguese and enhance knowledge of the diverse cultures of the Portuguese-speaking world.",

This evolving ‘Nigerian visual novel’, or ‘video novel’, is defined by its loosely structured, tabloid-themed and reader-friendly style, all reflecting the craft of Nollywood films, a thriving video film culture that emerged in the 1990s and has remained popular globally. Through the study of Nollywood films alongside new Nigerian fiction, the course will examine the techniques adopted by writers to accommodate the aesthetics of popular culture, to revive a declining readership, and to make literature more sellable. As these novels win literature prizes and find their way onto syllabi, the implications they have for our understanding of the African literary canon will be discussed. Students will view selected Nollywood movies and read a number of novels in the new genre in order to appraise the extent to which the serious and the sensuous intersect in this remaking of literariness. Seminar discussions will be accompanied by short lectures in which concepts such as ‘trans-mediality’, ‘reverse-adaptation’, ‘screen-to-page’, ‘appropriation’ and ‘quotation’ will be discussed to build an understanding of how the ‘new’ approach reconfigures Nigerian novels.",

From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race.

        "description": "Akkadian was one of the primary languages of ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), with an attested history of more than 2000 years (from the second half of the 3rd millennium BCE to the beginning of the Common Era). It is a Semitic language, similar to Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew, written on clay tablets in the Cuneiform script. Hundreds of thousands of documents in Akkadian have come down to us. They include everything from great works of literature like the Gilgamesh Epic, to everyday texts such as letters that document the lives of people from all walks of life, from great kings to commoners and slaves. Whether it be a letter to a paranoid emperor who refuses to eat and shuts himself in his own palace, or a particularly inept spy reporting to his superiors about the suspicious dreams of a suspected enemy of the state, knowledge of Akkadian opens a window into the world of those who lived thousands of years ago, the struggles they faced and the stories they told. Akkadian for Beginners provides students with the tools to begin to explore that ancient and once-forgotten world of ancient Mesopotamia. After finishing the course, students will have acquired a sound knowledge of Akkadian grammar and syntax, along with practice in Cuneiform.",

From the suspension of Puerto Rican sovereignty to the contemporary proliferation of ethnic studies bans, the state has used the law to delimit Latinx to transparent or static categories of irregular \"citizen,\" \"refugee,\" and \"migrant.\"  If conventional thinking assumes that art only responds to the law in protest or affirmation of the status quo, this seminar introduces students to the ways Latinx literature engages, resists, and disidentifies with the law as it delineates national belonging. We ask how do Latinx creative expressions expand the notions of citizenship, nation, and family beyond their raced, classed, and gendered origins to imagine new futures. Through attention to contemporary tv, film, novels, and poetry, we examine how Latinx artists build alternative forms of thriving collective life in forms of mutual aid, queer kinship, party, and protest. Works up for discussion include those by Justin Torres, Raquel Salas Rivera, and the television show Vida. Drawing inspiration from these texts, students collaborate on podcasts, write analytical essays, and complete other critical and creative projects.",

From Hannah Nikole Jones’ 1619 Project to the first Trump administration’s 1776 Commission, from the \"originalism\" or some members of the United States judiciary to the neo-monarchism of so-called \"dark enlightenment\" thinkers (the Enlightenment itself also being an eighteenth-century movement, if a relatively small one), the politics of our present moment regularly invoke early American history to ground and legitimate their ethical, political, historical, and visionary claims. While this course is primarily an introduction to early American studies—an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the period that draws on scholarship in history, literature, and law, among other fields— the course is organized into three sections, organized around three themes (sovereignty, labor, and governance), and at the end of each section we engage twenty-first century political debates surrounding these themes. This course focuses on British colonial North America, and then the early national United States before 1865, but readings cluster around the long eighteenth century. Topics may include the histories, geographies and politics of Native nations prior to the incursion of Europeans into the region; the labor cultures of bondage (chattel slavery) and indenture; anti-government, anti-monarchical and revolutionary movements; the legal architecture of Native dispossession; the beginnings of nationalist imperialism; the politics of democratic governance; regional, religion-based, and culturally-specific formations of gendered and sexual comportment; visual and/or literary arts of the era; abolitionist movements (temperance, anti-slavery); the creation of citizenship infrastructures as well as those controlling immigration and naturalization; and contemporary visions of what \"Americanness\" meant, looked like, or represented.",

From Hannah Nikole Jones’ 1619 Project to the first Trump administration’s 1776 Commission, from the \"originalism\" or some members of the United States judiciary to the neo-monarchism of so-called \"dark enlightenment\" thinkers (the Enlightenment itself also being an eighteenth-century movement, if a relatively small one), the politics of our present moment regularly invoke early American history to ground and legitimate their ethical, political, historical, and visionary claims. While this course is primarily an introduction to early American studies—an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the period that draws on scholarship in history, literature, and law, among other fields— the course is organized into three sections, organized around three themes (sovereignty, labor, and governance), and at the end of each section we engage twenty-first century political debates surrounding these themes. This course focuses on British colonial North America, and then the early national United States before 1865, but readings cluster around the long eighteenth century. Topics may include the histories, geographies and politics of Native nations prior to the incursion of Europeans into the region; the labor cultures of bondage (chattel slavery) and indenture; anti-government, anti-monarchical and revolutionary movements; the legal architecture of Native dispossession; the beginnings of nationalist imperialism; the politics of democratic governance; regional, religion-based, and culturally-specific formations of gendered and sexual comportment; visual and/or literary arts of the era; abolitionist movements (temperance, anti-slavery); the creation of citizenship infrastructures as well as those controlling immigration and naturalization; and contemporary visions of what \"Americanness\" meant, looked like, or represented.",

We examine manifestations of romantic love in medieval Arab cultures as precedents to the invention of courtly love. In the second part of our course, we turn to modern humanistic theories about romantic love. Among the questions that critical theorists and philosophers have posed, we consider: How is love related to desire? Is sexual desire an indispensable component of romantic love? Is romantic love ultimately a selfish, exclusionary act, or is it about renouncing the self, losing the self in the other? In the third part of our course, we apply the insights of parts 1 and 2 to discuss case studies of romantic love in the contemporary United States. In this section, we explore reining assumptions between romantic love and: marriage; monogamy; dating; the digital environment; queerness; age; and transnationalism.",

Materials for study include humanistic and social scientific critique, ethnographies of technology, technical writing and scientific papers, as well as speculative art practices including design, visual art and fiction. What assumptions and politics of imagination govern the design and development of new technologies? What alternative imaginaries, politics, or even speculations, can be identified with a feminist analytic lens? The seminar also includes a practicum component where we practice the politics of speculation through writing and design projects. To do this we study everything from active STEM projects at Yale to speculative fiction and film to think about how structures of race, gender, sexuality, ability, nation, and religious difference inform how we \"speculate\" or imagine the future through the ways we design and build technological worlds in practice and in fiction.",

This course provides a critical overview of digital war, understood as the relationship between war and digital technologies. Modern warfare has been shaped by digital technologies, but the latter have also been conditioned through modern conflict: DARPA (the research arm of the US Department of Defense), for instance, has innovated aspects of everything from GPS, to stealth technology, personal computing, and the Internet. Shifting beyond a sole focus on technology and its makers, this class situates the historical antecedents and present of digital war within colonialism and imperialism. We will investigate the entanglements between technology, empire, and war, and examine how digital war—also sometimes understood as virtual or remote war—has both shaped the lives of the targeted and been conditioned by imperial ventures. We will consider visual media, fiction, art, and other works alongside scholarly texts to develop a multidiscpinary perspective on the past, present, and future of digital war.",

Students will examine how theories of performativity have expanded our understanding of dramatic structure beyond traditional theatrical contexts. The course investigates how social movements, cultural rituals, and everyday interactions can be analyzed through dramaturgical frameworks, while broadening the definition of \"texts\" that can be adapted for performance. Through both theoretical study and practical application, students will develop core dramaturgical skills by analyzing diverse performance texts for structure, meaning, and cultural context. Course projects include collaborating on a literary adaptation with a director and participating in a devised work with a contemporary artist, emphasizing the dramaturg's role as a cultural interpreter, creative collaborator, and social critic in today's performance landscape.

The course draws from interdisciplinary scholarship addressing the intellectual landscape of Latina/x/e and critical race feminist theories and social movement activist organizing. While this course approaches Latina/x/e feminist theories and activism as often having emerged in relation to U.S. nation-making projects we will consider this work with the understanding that projects of Latina/x/e feminism should be understood as cross-border, transnational, and multi-scaler critiques of nation-state violence.",

        "description": "Uwe Johnson's Anniversaries: From A Year in the Life of Gesine Cresspahl remains a monument of postwar German literature – and it was written in and about New York City. Across its 367 short chapters (each corresponding to a day of the year), the novel unfolds on three levels: the historical present in New York, memories and family history from Germany, and reporting from the New York Times on current events. The result is a view of life, politics, and history in the middle of the 20th century that is as rich and expansive as it is fragmented. The social and political climate of New York in the late '60s is put into contact with memories of the rise of Nazism in Germany; reporting on the Vietnam war, the civil rights movement and the Prague Spring is refracted through the lenses of the protagonist's past life in East Germany and her new life raising her daughter alone in New York. This course undertakes a close reading of Johnson's sprawling novel with attention to its many historical, political, and literary contexts. Readings from the novel are complemented by relevant short readings on theories of media, politics, literature, and history. No prior knowledge of German language and literature is required.",

This brilliant coinage offers an immanent theorization of texture as something like an x-factor—an excess and an essence, something magical yet practical, a strange intensity and the thing itself. Such ambiguities, however, also contribute to texture’s interpretive difficulties. For whether we have in mind a velvet armchair, a pair of distressed jeans, a handbound book, or a tablet computer, texture performs a dramatic revelation to the extent that it is also shadowed by deception and ambivalence. These paradoxes and cruxes inspire a range of inquiries for our class: What can the perception and creation of texture teach us about the sensorial and material politics of race, gender, empire, capitalism, and art? How might texture help us study the relation between desire and violence, especially at the interface of touch? What things, beings, events, places, emotions, and ideas appear to have a texture? What is texture’s route to intelligibility, and is there a scale or unit at which texture vanishes?",

Topics include: metric space structures, curvature, geodesics, diffusion maps, eigenmaps, geometric model spaces, gradient descent, data embeddings and projections, and topological data analysis (TDA) in the form of persistence homology and their associated \"barcodes.\" We see applications of these methods in a variety of data types.",

The first part focuses on reading about truth, facts and skepticism, causality, inference, deductive and inductive reasoning, research questions, and formulation of hypotheses and predictions. The second part considers aspects related to the actual development and implementation of a scientific study including considerations of types of study (e.g, observational, experimental), study feasibility, sample size, selection and validity of variables, power analysis, confounding factors. The third part considers the analyses, interpretation and presentation of results, offering introductory explanations of a priori statistical protocols; predictive and/or explanatory power and interpretation of both statistical significance and research relevance. The course is neither a lecture or seminar, but instead each meeting is a hybrid of both formats; a format where students are required to be active participants in the process of learning.",

It presents evidence from evolutionary and life history theory, geochronology, paleontology, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, phylogenetic analysis, genetics, archaeology, and functional morphology. It also tackles the issue of how we know what we think we know of our own ancestry over the past 6 million years. In other words, what constitutes evidence for human evolution and how is that evidence interpreted? Students are introduced to basic milestones in human evolution and learn how they have shaped us into the species we are today, using diverse lines of evidence from evolutionary and life history theory, geochronology, paleontology, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, phylogenetic analysis, genetics, archaeology, and functional morphology. We critically examine key debates that have taken place over the last century of exploration in human evolutionary research, learning how unconventional thinking and spectacular discoveries have shaped current knowledge of our origins. Students meet strange and fascinating historical characters, and then meet our fossil ancestors via the cast collection. Students also receive hands-on and interactive learning about the morphology, life history patterns, locomotion, social behavior, and diet of our nearest fossil relatives; observe living primates to assess what they can tell us about our own deep past; dive into data collection by locating real archaeological and fossil sites; and learn how molecular techniques such as ancient DNA have transformed understanding of the origins of our own species. By formally debating controversial issues with classmates, students learn what a surprising amount of information scientists can discern from fragmentary fossils, and are brought up to date with the most current discoveries in human evolution.",

From the holy city of Mecca to the sacred landscape of Banaras in India, religious traditions are tethered to sacred geographies. These locations are often physical sites imbued with sacred energies and social meaning. Religious activities can occur in churches or mosques, forests or mountains, community centers, public squares, or homes. The course materials consider specific religious sites and contexts (including those on the Yale campus), examining how these places simultaneously become sites of worship, articulations of identity and heritage, claims of political significance, and hubs of social and emotional life. Special attention is given to how space and place are gendered, racialized, and shaped by emotions, senses, and memories.",

Since their discovery in 1856, they have fascinated the public with their position as our closest, yet extinct, relatives. For decades Neanderthals were portrayed as nasty, brutish, and passively lacking the talent and innovation that allowed humans to survive and thrive. Recently, they have become celebrated as our close cousins or even just another group of ancient humans. But what does modern science say about Neanderthal life and extinction, and what do Neanderthals tell us about ourselves? By asking the question \"were Neanderthals human,\" this course examines what it actually means to be human. Students learn the archaeological, fossil, and biomolecular records of Neanderthals, early modern humans, and other contemporaneous human relatives.  They also learn the foundations of human evolutionary science, with a focus on the Middle and Late Pleistocene (770,000 to 11,500 years ago), when the genus Homo diversified into as many as seven species–including our own.",

What were the roots and social processes that gave rise to such systems? In this seminar, we explore archaeological evidence for the development of social and political organization and religious practices, using selected examples from East and Southeast Asia spanning approximately 5000 BCE to 1500 CE. We examine four key themes: (1) the origins and timing of plant and animal domestication, (2) the emergence and impact of early metallurgy, (3) patterns of interregional interaction, and (4) the rise of sociopolitical complexity. Using a comparative archaeological perspective—focusing on settlement patterns, urbanism, craft production, monumentality, and diverse material culture—we examine how both local factors and long-distance connections shaped these trajectories. We conclude the course with a reflection on the role of archaeology in contemporary society, particularly in countries where the past is actively curated, celebrated, and contested.",

This course re-examines the societies of the modern Middle East from the perspective of the pilgrim, the refugee, the traveller, and the trader. Where traditional approaches took sedentariness and stasis as their starting point, we will begin with movement, displacement, uprootedness, and migration. Readings will explore how migration and movement have shaped the region's social, cultural, and economic structures over time. But rather than focus on case studies in particular countries, we will follow the flow of peoples, objects, capital, and ideas wherever they take us, from Egypt and Lebanon to India, the Netherlands, and Chile. Readings are organized by theme, from economic migration and wartime displacement to religious pilgrimage and intellectual exchange. There is some focus on the modern and contemporary periods but we will be engaging both historical and ethnographic research and modes of analysis.",

This course invites students from the natural and exact sciences—and anyone curious about the power of knowledge—to explore how to turn complex ideas into stories that inspire, inform, and empower diverse audiences. Blending theory and practice, we will experiment with different media platforms: from writing and museum exhibits to live performance and digital storytelling. Special attention will be given to cultural context: how does science communication change across borders, languages, and worldviews? For students affiliated with CLAIS, the course will also offer deeper engagement with Latin American approaches to science, narrative, and public dialogue. Students will leave the course with practical communication skills, a portfolio of creative work, and a critical understanding of how science lives in society—not just as facts and data, but as a shared human endeavor.",

The rich and varied definitions of food have also enabled humans, the animal at the top of the food chains, to create many new ones. Food enters and becomes a part of the human body; in other words, the food we consume has become ourselves. How we define food also determines the way in which we relate to other living beings. We will explore cultural practices of food chains in East Asian societies, with a focus on China, Japan, and South Korea. class will guide students to think about the origins, production, and creation of food, as well as the politics, ethics, and technologies that are intertwined with the circulation of food. By reading ethnographies of food, this class provides students with the theoretical and methodological means to observe and analyze perhaps the most common thing in life. Food is not just a static object, but part of the global food chains that are constantly circulating, and part of the circulation with the human body.",

Indigenous peoples always fare far worse than non-indigenous ones in terms of health status. No matter where one looks, there are substantial health disparities between indigenous and non-indigenous populations in the form of mortality and morbidity gaps. We go over the epidemiological landscape of indigenous populations and discuss causes of death and sickness, which vary from population to population. We then expand on some of the possible interactive causes of these disparities, particularly the role that globalization and market integration is having in shaping the health situation of indigenous peoples. Finally, we discuss the current surge of Global Health Programs, mainly at academic or research institutions in the northern hemisphere and the contribution of anthropology to those programs.",

How societies remember difficult pasts has become a contested site for negotiating the present. Through the lens of memory, we examine complex roles that our relationships to difficult pasts play in navigating issues we face today. This course explores this politics of memory that takes place in the realm of popular culture and public space. The class asks such questions as: How do you represent difficult and contested pasts? What does it mean to enable long-silenced victims’ voices to be heard? What are the consequences of re-narrating the past by highlighting past injuries and trauma? Does memory work heal or open wounds of a society and a nation? Through examples drawn from the Holocaust, the atomic bombing in Hiroshima, the Vietnam War, genocide in Indonesia and massacres in Lebanon, to debates on confederacy statues, slavery, and lynching in the US, this course approaches these questions through an anthropological exploration of concepts such as memory, trauma, mourning, silence, voice, testimony, and victimhood.",

It turns out that even the simplest projects to improve the human condition have a wide range of surprising, unintended consequences. In this course, we develop qualitative social science methods (ways of asking questions and ways of answering them) to better grapple with the inherently social contexts in which international development plays out. Instructor permission required.",

In addition, the General Theory of Relativity opened up for the first time a quantitative study of cosmology, of the history of the universe as a whole. Albert Einstein was at the center of these breakthroughs, and also became an iconic figure beyond physics, representing scientist genius engaged in pure research into the fundamental laws of nature. This course addresses the nature of the transition to modern physics, underpinned by quantum and relativity theory, through study of Einstein’s science, biography, and historical context. It also presents the basic concepts in electromagnetic theory, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, special theory of relativity, and quantum mechanics which were central to this revolutionary epoch in science.",

It covers the historical framework, the evolution of ancient Egyptian art and architecture, and material culture, and includes specific case studies of important archaeological sites and discoveries. This course is the first of two introductory lecture courses. However, it is not necessary to take both parts, and the order in which you take them does not matter. Discussion sections are included.",

Steeped within the histories of science, technology, and the environment, the course presents a variety of approaches to how people have come to know the world around them and what they have done to account for environmental change.",

Our cities and their socioeconomic and built environments continue to exemplify difference. From housing and health to mobility and monuments, cities small and large, north and south, continue to demonstrate intractable disparities. The disparate impacts made apparent by the COVID-19 pandemic and the reinvigorated and global Black Lives Matter movement demanding change are remarkable. Change, of course, is another essential indicator of difference in urban environments, exemplified by the phenomena of disinvestment or gentrification. This course explores how issues like climate change and growing income inequality intersect with politics, culture, gender equality, immigration and migration, technology, and other considerations and forms of disruption.",

Through studio projects, lectures, and critiques, we will explore both a personal and technological understanding of the print medium. Where and how does it share a commonality with literature, sculpture, photography and the moving image?  We will experiment with various techniques, including intaglio (dry-point etching, hard ground, aquatint), monotype, relief (linocut), and screen printing. Students will demonstrate critical thinking skills by engaging in a dialogue about their own work and the work of others. The themes of experimentation, reproducibility, storytelling, play, and patience will be particularly highlighted.",

Our animating question throughout the term is: \"can graphic design be understood as a form of activism or protest?\"  Looking to histories of graphic innovation linked to diverse social interests (among them, Black power, women’s liberation, queer activism, environmentalism, the antiwar movement, independence movements, etc.), we will study the ways in which collective practices fashion the image of a culture in times of pronounced political change: as a vehement challenge to the dominance of official media and a critical form of self-representation. One goal is to consider the implications of such work in the present, a moment in which corporate media, misinformation campaigns, and algorithmic capitalism has exerted decisive control over public discourse.",

Muralists take risks when they commit to an art practice that is outside the museum or gallery. They must negotiate both multiple, unpredictable publics, their own privacy, and the socio-political ‘publicness’ of their work. Community-engaged artmaking provokes, mobilizes, and forever alters the spaces and audiences it encounters. Course topics include Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel, Mexican muralists and revolution, civic mural movements in the U.S., graffiti as a global phenomenon, and murals in the region, such as New Haven and New York City. This course includes art history through practice, creating a more integrated way of learning the history of mural making, from prehistory to the present, by collectively painting a mural in the Peabody Museum. Working with a local muralist, students learn how to navigate the process of creating a mural, from the proposal to the budget to the community programming and the execution. There are no artistic skills required.",

In the early 1960s, influenced by the composer John Cage, a group of young American choreographers began to invent new choreographic structures to frame the actions of everyday life. Through learning dances created in the 1960s and 70s, we will trace this evolving history. We will study the social and historical context in which the work emerged, specific challenges to the form, and the pervasive influence of these aesthetics in dance, performance, and visual art to this day. All levels of dance background are welcome. Admission is by permission of the instructor. This course is inclusive and open to all physical abilities; no prior experience in dance is required.",

There is also considerable hype surrounding AI and many concerns (some justified, some not) regarding the use of this type of technology. This discussion-based seminar will 1) provide undergraduate students across disciplines with a broad overview of issues related to AI in medicine at a non-technical level, drawing on perspectives from the interpretive/humanistic social sciences, computing, engineering, and healthcare and 2) model interdisciplinary communication and build a robust framework for collaboration. Overarching topics, grounded in medical case studies, include what it means for computers to \"think\" and how we understand what they are thinking about; the use and limits of scientific knowledge in making policy decisions; bias, fairness, equity, equality; the challenges of implementation of AI systems; safety and risk; and the human/computer interface. The course also provides a high level overview of machine learning, discussing opportunities, limitations, and tradeoffs. Ultimately, the course offers a grounded look at how AI is being discussed and deployed on the ground in medicine, equipping students with a critical lens for thinking about responsible and practical implementation and innovation when it comes to AI.",

        "description": "Biological systems make sophisticated decisions at many levels. This course explores the molecular and computational underpinnings of how these decisions are made, with a focus on modeling static and dynamic processes in example biological systems. This course is aimed at biology students and teaches the analytic and computational methods needed to model genetic networks and protein signaling pathways. Students present and discuss original papers in class. They learn to model using MatLab in a series of in-class hackathons that illustrate the biological examples discussed in the lectures. Biological systems and processes that are modeled include: (i) gene expression, including the kinetics of RNA and protein synthesis and degradation; (ii) activators and repressors; (iii) the lysogeny/lysis switch of lambda phage; (iv) network motifs and how they shape response dynamics; (v) cell signaling, MAP kinase networks and cell fate decisions; and (vi) noise in gene expression.",

This course provides students a theoretical base in child development and behavior and tools to sensitively and carefully observer infants and young children. The seminar will consider aspects of cognitive, social, and emotional development. An assumption of this course is that it is not possible to understand children – their behavior and development—without understanding their families and culture and the relationships between children and parents. The course will give an overview of the major theories in the field, focusing on the complex interaction between the developing self and the environment, exploring current research and theory as well as practice. Students will have the opportunity to see how programs for young children use psychodynamic and interactional theories to inform the development of their philosophy and curriculum. Weekly Observations:-Total Time Commitment 3 hours per week. Students will do two separate weekly observations over the course of the semester. They will observe in a group setting for 2 hours each each week at a Yale affiliated child care center.  Students will also arrange to do a weekly 1 hour observation (either in person or virtually) of a child under the age of 6. Students must make their own arrangements for these individual observations. If it is not possible to arrange a child to observe, please do not apply to take this course. For a portion of class meetings, the class will divide into small supervisory discussion groups.",

        "description": "The canonical Greek tragedians—Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides—dramatize fundamental and discomfiting questions that are often sidelined by the philosophical tradition. In this seminar, we read plays about death, war, revenge, madness, impossible choices, calamitous errors, and the destruction of whole peoples. Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were also piercing observers of political life. No less than Plato and Aristotle, the Attic tragedians write to elicit reflection on the basic patterns of politics: democracy and tyranny, war and peace, the family and the city, the rule of law and violence. Finally, we also approach Greek tragedy through its reception. Aristophanes, Plato, Aristotle, and Nietzsche: all these thinkers responded to tragedy. Texts include Aeschylus, Oresteia; Aristophanes, Frogs and Lysistrata; Euripides, Bacchae, Heracles, and Trojan Women; Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy; Plato, Symposium; and Sophocles, Antigone, Philoctetes, and Oedipus Tyrannus.",

The two main contexts under discussion allow us to investigate one ‘edge’ shared between two empires (Roman Syria) and in the other a world of many overlapping ‘edges’ (southern Italy ca. 400-100 BCE). The Yale University Art Gallery collections from the city of Dura-Europos in Roman Syria are used extensively.",

This seminar explores Canada’s long, complex history, and striking linguistic diversity by exploring its literary (and at moments, its cinematic) traditions. Like Canada itself, its literature represents a \"contact zone\" between First Nations peoples, French and British settlers, and immigrants from Eastern Europe, East and South Asia, and the Caribbean. We focus particularly on Canada’s diverse early literatures (from oral tradition and Jesuit hymn to a sentimental novel-in-letters); on the unusually prominent role of women writers across Canadian literary history; on the emergence of an experimental Québecois and francophone literature (which utilized both Montreal patois and Acadian French as new literary languages); on the differences between French and English Canadian cultural nationalism; on attempts to rethink colonial history and critiques of Canada’s ongoing decolonization process by generations of Indigenous, immigrant and ethnic writers. This course explores both literary history and literary form; works by internationally famous writers (Leonard Cohen, Marie-Claire Blais, Margaret Atwood, Alice Munro, Michael Ondaatje, Rohinton Mistry) and innovative local counterparts. The course concludes with several weeks on recent First Nations writing.",

What can they tell us about the past? How do we analyze the roles of the narrator, the author, and the protagonist? How should we understand the ideological tensions between official histography and personal reminiscences, especially in 20th-century Russia? This course aims to answer these questions through close readings of a few cultural celebrities’ memoirs and autobiographical writings that are also widely acknowledged as the best representatives of 20th-century Russian prose. Along the way, we read literary texts in dialogue with theories of memory, historiography, and narratology. Students acquire the theoretical apparatus that enables them to analyze the complex ideas, e.g. cultural memory and trauma, historicity and narrativity, and fiction and non-fiction. Students finish the course with an in-depth knowledge of the major themes of 20th-century Russian history, e.g. empire, revolution, war, Stalinism, and exilic experience, as well as increased skills in the analysis of literary texts. Students with knowledge of Russian are encouraged to read in the original language. All readings are available in English.",

Bradley's Appearance and Reality. Further reading includes Eliot’s earlier poetry, especially \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,\" and his own criticism of the period, including \"Tradition and the Individual Talent,\" \"The Metaphysical Poets,\" and \"Ulysses, Order and Myth.\" We also consider critical appraisals of the poem by Virginia Woolf, F.R. Leavis and Ralph Ellison, be attentive to comparable aesthetic innovations of the period in painting and music (cubism, Stravinsky's Le sacre du printemps, ragtime), and listen to audio recordings of Eliot (and others) reading the poem.

Often described as \"New Waves,\" this new cinema responded to social change and intervened in it, attempting to understand and critique the social order even as it participated in popular culture and reworked film aesthetics. This course focuses on the new waves of European cinema, East and West. Within the broader trends of destalizination, decolonization, and the rise of youth and women’s movements, we consider flashpoints including 1968 and the Vietnam War alongside the transformations in work, gender roles, and the qualities of everyday life—legacies that remain with us to this day (along with elements of 60s film style).

We consider both poetry and prose from the Bible, selections from Chinese, Greek, and Latin verse, classical Arabic and Persian literature, prose by Cervantes, Borges, and others, and modern European poetry (including Pushkin, Baudelaire, and Rilke). Students are expected to prepare short class presentations, participate in a weekly workshop, try their hand at a series of translation exercises, and undertake an intensive, semester-long translation project.

The course explores famous works that have been considered aesthetically, morally, ideologically and politically pernicious (stopping short, however, of screeds and manifestos like Hitler's Mein Kampf).

Taking a chronological frame, we cover these themes beginning with medieval Iberian pageantry and ending with the works of Pedro Calderón de la Barca and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. To guide and nuance our class discussions and readings, we interrogate the staging and performance of class, gender, race, and sexuality along the lines of: courtly and civic coronations, pageantry, and tournaments; the Renaissance underworld of La Celestina; the short-skit interludes of Lope de Rueda; Lope de Vega and the comedia nueva; African dances and blackface performance; cross-dressing and gender dissidence in Tirso de Molina and Sor Juana; queer readings of Agustín Moreto’s El lindo Don Diego; celebrity and the stardom of actors; clothing, cosmetics, and stage props; and, architecture, urban space and cities.",

        "description": "Although we spend approximately one third of our lives asleep, since the industrial revolution and the emergence of uninterrupted city lighting, industrialized societies seem to have developed an ambivalent relation to sleep: both protected and devalued for the sake of higher standards of productive work. The devaluation of sleep, in particular, has produced, during the twentieth and the first two decades of the twenty-first centuries, an array of social, political, and medical discourses to study the impact of changing patterns of sleep and sleeplessness at the global level. This seminar studies topics in the politics and cultures of sleep and sleeplessness, which posit sleep as a human practice. As any human practice, it is framed by cultural and political settings, so that how, when, why, where, and who sleeps vary across sectors of society, across past and present and across world cultures. We study historical, literary, philosophical, sociological, political, and filmic texts. A cultural, social, and political understanding of sleep and sleeplessness can reveal how sleep has been transformed into a bodily site upon which social values are imposed, social surveillance is enacted, ideas about \"normality\" are instrumentalized, resulting in a demand that humans adapt to human-made changing conditions of production, rather than universally unchanging health needs.",

In the last decades, novel computational problems, whose hardness is related to lattices, have been instrumental in cryptography by offering: (a) a basis for \"post-quantum\" cryptography, (b) cryptographic constructions based on worst-case hard problems, (c) numerous celebrated cryptographic protocols unattainable from other cryptographic assumptions. This course covers the foundations of lattice-based cryptography from fundamental definitions to advanced cryptographic constructions. More precisely, we introduce the Learning with Error (LWE) and the Short Integer Solutions (SIS) problems and study their unique properties, such as the fact that their average-case hardness is based on the worst-case hardness of lattice problems. Next, we cover lattice constructions of advanced cryptographic primitives, such as fully homomorphic encryption and signature schemes. Finally, we introduce some notions of quantum cryptography and explore the role of lattices in this area. Overall, this course offers insights into the foundations and recent advancements in lattice-based cryptography.",

In the digital world today, we trust services to perform many kinds of computations on our data, from managing financial ledgers and databases to complex analytics. We trust these services not only to operate correctly, but also to keep our information private. Proof systems allow us to remove this trust. A succinct proof system is a system that enables a service to attach a small certificate on the correctness of its computation, and the certificate can be verified by small devices, even if the original computation needs substantial computation to compute this result. Beyond correctness, a zero-knowledge proof system enables us to prove knowledge of secret information, including hidden inputs to a computation that achieves a certain output. Both types of proof systems have incredible applications to privacy and verifiability in a decentralized web.",

How do we account for strong adversaries that violate the privacy of users providing this data? This course will provide you with the knowledge to tackle research questions in these domains. We will propose answers and techniques to these broad questions from an algorithmic standpoint, presenting foundational topics such as:1) The parallel, distributed, and streaming models and algorithmic techniques commonly used within these models 2) Differential privacy and mechanisms for private data analysis 3) Implementation techniques, tools, and examples that demonstrate the practicality of these algorithms in real-world systems. This course focuses on advanced topics in practical graph algorithms with provable guarantees beyond the sequential model used in most introductory algorithms classes. Specific topics include local graph techniques for problems such as maximal matching, independent set, k-core decomposition, densest subgraphs, and coloring as well as global techniques for problems like connectivity, shortest paths, and spanners. Introductory lectures will also feature techniques used beyond graph algorithms. Students are asked to read and present influential recent research papers on these topics. Papers come from prominent CS theory conferences such as STOC, FOCS, SODA as well as database and data mining conferences like VLDB, PODS, and WWW. In addition to these presentations, students also work on a final project which may be theoretical or implementation-based. The course will also feature voluntary open problem sections where we discuss (known) practice problems and open-ended research questions related to the topics in this course in a collaborative group setting.",

Human-generated data is being recorded at unprecedented rates and scales, and powerful AI and ML algorithms, which are capable of learning from such data, are increasingly controlling various aspects of modern society: from social interactions. These data-driven decision-making algorithms have a tremendous potential to change our lives for the better, but, via the ability to mimic and nudge human behavior, they also have the potential to be discriminatory, reinforce societal prejudices, violate privacy, polarize opinions, and influence democratic processes. Thus, designing effective tools to govern modern society which reinforce its cherished values such as equity, justice, democracy, health, privacy, etc. has become paramount and requires a foundational understanding of how humans, data, and algorithms interact. This course is for students who would like to understand and address some of the key challenges and emerging topics at the aforementioned interplay between computation and society. On the one hand, we study human decision-making processes and view them through the lens of computation and on the other hand we study and address the limitations of artificial decision-making algorithms when deployed in various societal contexts. The focus is on developing solutions through a combination of foundational work such as coming up with the right definitions, modeling, algorithms, and empirical evaluation. The current focus is on bias and privacy, with additional topics including robustness, polarization, and democratic representation.",

CI involves a heightened sense of listening, sensory perception, and attuning of physical reflexes, as well as a careful attention to weight, momentum, orientation to gravity and physical connection or contact with one’s partner. We use the structure of a physical practice-based Contact Improvisation laboratory as a springboard to examine connections and discrepancies between CI and democratic process, with special focus on activism in South Africa, Spain, and the US. We also investigate liberation pedagogies from the Global South, along with theories of cognition, behavior, and freedom, through both traditional seminar word-based dialogue and body-based conversation, as well as creative assignments and reflection activities. Through an embodied investigation of roles and habits in self-other relationships, the course carries strong thematic connections with human rights, gender, critical race and cultural studies; psychology, politics and anthropology; architecture and visual arts; physics, evolutionary biology, and journalism. CI also fosters a grounded sense of weight and presence in solo, duet and group composition, useful for performers in theater, dance and other forms.",

However, real-world, high-impact machine learning applications demand more than just model performance. In particular, deep learning models are often required to be \"trustworthy,\" so that domain experts can trust that the models consistently behave in a way that corresponds to their domain knowledge. For example, medical experts would expect a deep learning diagnosis model to be able to explicitly utilize medical domain knowledge in its prediction; an insurance company would expect a decision on insurance price to be explainable in terms of risk factors; a financial company would expect its fraud detection model to be robust to adversarial attacks; a physicist would expect models to provide consistency with the underlying laws. This course introduces various fields of trustworthy deep learning, including model robustness, defenses for adversarial attacks, interpretability, explainability, fairness, privacy, domain adaptation, rules, and constraints. The course covers some of these aspects in the context of graph neural networks but also covers many other ML models in general deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.",

How do entrepreneurs develop the capabilities, mindsets, and identities required to build organizations? Traditional approaches to startup education focus on the mechanics of company building—fundraising, product development, go-to-market strategies. Yet the founder's journey is equally about personal transformation: aligning personal motivations with business model and fundraising decisions, building relationships with co-founders and early employees, understanding when to pivot or stay the course, managing self-doubt, and continuously evolving one's identity and capabilities as the company grows. Through a combination of theoretical frameworks, case studies, narrative non-fiction, and direct engagement with successful investors and entrepreneurs, we examine how to navigate the most critical junctures in the journey of turning an idea into an enduring business. The course focuses on both the mechanics of building organizations and the personal choices that define the founding process. Students develop practical and personal frameworks for entrepreneurship while engaging directly with their own entrepreneurial aspirations.",

This course is designed to be experiential, personal, and holistic. Emotional depth, wholeness in the self, the ability to change, and the means of figuring out how we want to live are not innate talents people are born with, but rather, muscles–ways of thinking, being, and acting–that each of us can work on and develop.",

Broken into three parts, the seminar builds a theoretical base by studying the social and economic costs of climate change and the disproportionate impact on poorer nations and people of color, with particular emphasis on the rising costs in the U.S. in the evolving political environment. The second part of the course explores various innovative technologies to mitigate and adapt to climate change and how a collaborative approach involving governments, corporations, capital markets, banks, and philanthropies, working in concert can accelerate the deployment of these technologies. Led by a practitioner with a passion for climate change and 27 years of experience in investment banking and sustainable finance, the last part of the course includes an introduction to investing in climate technology and a discussion of what we all can do to effect change.",

The work of uncovering this abuse is left largely to investigative sports journalists who in recent years have exposed the NFL’s coverup of its concussion data, the sexual abuse of gymnasts by team doctors, and the deaths of migrant workers building FIFA’s World Cup, to name a few.

        "description": "This course is an introduction to entertainment law, designed specifically for college students. It is helpful to filmmakers and musicians in particular since they learn how to protect their creative works such as film, sound recordings and musical compositions in two important ways. In the first phase of the course, students learn how to create, distribute and market content legally by examining how various legal issues affect entertainment. For example, the following issues are discussed: How sexual and violent can the content of entertainment be under the First Amendment? What rights do celebrities have against defamation and invasion of privacy? How do copyright, trademark and \"moral\" rights apply to entertainment? How does copyright apply to artificial intelligence generating entertainment? In the second, business-oriented phase of the course, students learn how to protect creative works by means of contract. Specifically, they review, negotiate and draft contracts which are customarily used in the film, television and music industries on behalf of producers and talent within industry parameters. This course is helpful to also any undergraduate who is contemplating law school since they are exposed to several basic areas of law, which entertainment law encompasses.",

As the largest school district in the U.S., NYC Public Schools provide a microcosm of many trends in public education in America, and an excellent jumping-off place to analyze and discuss important aspects of education policy and reform. Policies have been aggressively implemented in NYC with interesting, sometimes positive, outcomes for students, and these reforms have implications for policy initiatives in public schools throughout the country. Issues to be addressed include school system governance, mayoral control, race and segregation, school size, school finance equity, charter schools versus district schools, school equity, and \"turnaround\" school models.",

We trace some of the history of journalism and writing online, and the different forms that it has taken. We think about questions like: Does the internet even have a style? How can we use it to make our writing more timely and lively? This is a craft-based nonfiction writing course, and one that’s grounded in readings that are historical and sometimes theoretical—it aims to give students a sense of how the writing on the internet came to be what it is today. It also aims to be practical, in terms of teaching young writers about how the landscape of online publishing works. We learn about pitching, editing and self-editing, and paths a career might take in an increasingly digital media. We read more traditional essays, alongside Substacks by writers including Mary Gaitskill and Brandon Taylor; we look at New York Times critic Amanda Hess’s \"Internetting\" video series, alongside the poet Kevin Killian’s experiments in writing Amazon reviews.",

How might we understand this refusal, neither as protest nor as admission of decolonization's futility, but as a sovereign practice of constraint? What new political acts might emerge if we think of such limits, less as oppressive limitations, than as productive sites of engagement? Could such constrained activism avoid both (post)colonial government mandates and also the resistance modalities typically used to counter state structures (modalities that often engage the state on its own terms)? This course takes diverse Indigenous acts and theories of refusal as a starting point for examining related practices within a global, comparative framework. Emphasizing ethnographic disciplines, the course also draws from rhetoric, history, politics, and arts disciplines to unpack refusal's nuances as an endeavor defined by additive action as much as by restriction. Discussing current events, readings, multimedia, guest visits, and performances, students learn the practices of sacrifice and rejection that have remade both Indigenous and migrant/settler/diasporic political lives.",

Students also explore how comedy creates identity, asserts culture and shares folklore through the emotional expression of shared laughter. In addition to studying a wide range of standup performers, comedy movements, and styles, students craft their own standup comedy set for a final class show. Through videos, podcasts, readings, and instruction on material generation and joke writing, students examine the broad purpose of this art form, uncover their own personal brand of comedy.

We fear that we will be exploited and deceived (leaving money on the table) or that others will see us as too demanding or too greedy (and therefore untrustworthy). Game Theory in Action brings math and logic to the bargaining table. Students compete in seven simulated negotiations, progressing to business situations drawn from the sports, gaming, and entertainment industries. Poker is our entry point to game theory, teaching us to estimate expected value, detect patterns in opponents’ behavior, and bluff selectively to avoid being exploited. Game Theory in Action draws on academic literature, the instructor’s three decades of experience in high-stakes negotiations, and the expertise of senior executives in sports, media, and entertainment.",

Our reading is guided by a different \"ism\" each week, from 19th-century eroticism and exoticism, through mid-century cosmopolitanism and colonialism, to second-wave feminism and existentialism in the wake of World War II. These distinct moments in the development of Japanese modernism (modanizumu) are shaped by encounters with foreign cultures, and by the importing of foreign ideas and vogues. All the same, we question—along with modernist writer Yū Ryūtanji–the \"critique that says modanizumu is nothing more than the latest display of imported cosmetics\" (1930). We seek to develop a correspondingly nuanced picture of the specific and changing ways in which Japan understood and figured its relationship to the rest of the world through the course of a century.",

Observing such temporalities, we analyze narrative murals and handscrolls, \"this life\" v. afterlife in funeral art, paintings of immortality, the significance of bronze corrosion in antiquarianism, uses of the past in traditional Chinese painting and contemporary art, the future and agelessness in movies and digital art, the materiality and nostalgia of old photography and time-based artworks, as well as the history of People’s Republic of China as presented at the Tian’anmen Square.",

It addresses a set of themes whose point of entry is the entangled character of visual production and reception in Japan at a tipping point in the emergence of global modernity, when what were called the Nanbans—\"Southern Barbarians,\" i.e. Europeans—began to arrive in Japan. The question of whether or not much-theorized nomenclatures such as baroque, rococo, mestizo, and even global modernity are pertinent to analysis from the Japanese and Asian perspective constitutes the backbone of the course and its primary objective in the study of a corpus of visual materials spanning the European and Asian cultural spheres. As such the seminar is not only about Japan, per se, or about Japanese objects, or the shogunal eye. It is equally about how Japan and Japanese objects and materials, along with objects and materials from other places, figured in a greater community of exchange, friction, confrontation, conquest, and adaptation in times when Portuguese marauders, Jesuit missionaries, Muslim traders, and Japanese pirates found themselves in the same waters, on ships laden with goods, making landfall in the domains of Japan’s great military hegemons.",

Split into three modules, we consider how the Japanese government and society have responded to environmental change, degradation, and destruction. The first module—Tokugawa Nature (1600-1868)—examines shifts in agriculture and forestry, urbanization, and the emergence of scholarly knowledge of the natural world. The second module—Modern Transformation (1868-1945)—focuses on Japan’s rapid industrialization, disaster preparedness, and imperial expansion, tracing the environmental consequences of these processes on both the archipelago and East Asia. The third module—Postwar Developmentalism (1946-present)—addresses industrial pollution diseases, the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and the environmental struggles related to the American military bases in Okinawa.",

The rapid advancement of new technologies in the 21st century necessitates new laws and regulations. Therefore, in addition to traditional law and economics topics, the course explores recent developments in the regulation of new technologies and estimates the causal effect of changes in law on economic performance. The study of legal statutes and regulations provides an opportunity to apply microeconomic tools to substantive policy issues. Price theory, game theory, agency theory, and models of trade with asymmetric information are among the tools that are utilized. These tools provide a framework for understanding and predicting the consequences of legal changes. The empirical literature reviewed in the course provides estimates on the magnitude of the effects that legal changes have on economic performance and individual well-being.",

We discuss and analyze data on regional economic activity and how economic shocks propagate in space. We pair those data with simple models where geography plays a crucial role in the determination of economic activity and discuss how changes in this geography lead some regions to grow and economic outcomes to diverge. Various policies that affect the spatial allocation of economic activity, such as infrastructure investment, local taxes, and transfers, are analyzed",

Is there something wrong with these queries, with the assumptions we have about them—and what assumptions are those, anyways? This course will be an examination of the history, sociology, politics, and philosophy of education, as well as a critical examination of the scholarly study of education. Although there has probably never been more research into learning and schools, our presuppositions about what education should be have, in fact, narrowed and hardened. This course aims both to break and to refresh them. Examples will range chronologically from ancient to modern times, and will be taken from a broad range of traditions and institutions. Particular attention will be paid to the origins and growth of the research university, and the costs and benefits involved in the modern institutionalization of learning. We will focus on—in the words of a noted, but now neglected Yale psychologist (Seymour Sarason)—how education has, especially in modern western societies like ours, become both \"scapegoat and salvation.\"",

Topics covered include carbon stock measurement, biodiversity assessment, utilization of digital conservation resources, experimental design, sampling methodology, and statistical analysis. The course includes intensive field exercises focused on forest measurements and soil analysis that ecologists use to understand ecosystem function. The second component of the course allows students to use these skills to design, conduct, analyze and present data in the form of a rapid ecological assessment or group research project on a local property of conservation importance.",

Researchers studying organisms’ ecomorphology ask questions like, \"What does the morphology of an organism tell us about its relationship with its environment\" and \"How are correlations between morphology and ecology influenced by behavior?\" The answers to questions like these inform evolutionary hypotheses based on natural selection and help to explain the amazing diversity of life forms that surround us. In this course, we explore the links between organismal form, function, ecology, and evolution using a series of readings and guided discussions. Students also learn many of the fundamentals associated with crafting and revising publishable scientific writing–a must for those seeking research-based graduate education in the sciences. By the end of the semester, students refine their critical thinking and scientific writing skills, and they have a newfound awareness of one of the most integrative and fascinating branches of vertebrate biology.",

These are all words in the English language, but, like all words, they have different meanings, functions, and social purposes; indeed, the meaning and function may be different for the same word depending on the context in which we use it (whether spoken or written). In this course, we explore the wonderful world of words. We look at how we create new words (and why), how we change the meaning of words, and how words have been lost (and revived) over time. As we do so, we look at debates over words and their meanings now (such as the feeling by some that ain’t is not a word at all) and historically (such as the distaste for subpeditals for ‘shoes’ in the sixteenth century), and how words can be manipulated to insult, hurt, and discriminate against others. We look at a wide range of texts by well-known authors (such as Shakespeare) as well as anonymous online bloggers, and we make use of online tools like the Google Ngram viewer and the Corpus of Historical American English to see how words change over time. At the end of the course, I hope you see how we make sophisticated use of words and how studying them opens up new ways for you to understand why other people use words the way they do and how you can use words for various purposes in your own speech and writing.",

Taught by current editors of The Yale Review, and housed at the Review’s offices, this course offers students invaluable hands-on experience at a state-of-the-art literary and cultural magazine. They’ll emerge from it equipped with a new set of skills, making them sharper readers, bolder creative writers, and better editors. Reading as an editor offers students a unique perspective on today’s literary landscape, deepens their understanding of style, form, and genre—and gives them practical skills involved in 21st-century publishing. Students are introduced to the concept of assigning pieces and thinking about what kind of magazine stories can add value to an ever-more fast-paced and reactive media landscape. They read fiction and nonfiction submissions from our queue and discuss which pieces might be worth publishing, and why. And they follow and work on drafts of pieces as they go through the process of editing, promotion, and publication. Along the way, they may also write and revise a creative piece of their own, becoming better writers by learning to read and think as editors. Formerly ENGL 413.",

Adaptations of certain authors and texts have given rise to entire sub-genres and cottage industries. We consider what adaptations of literary texts, particularly very famous and beloved texts, might help us understand better about the texts themselves, and about the needs and expectations of the audiences of their adaptations. To that purpose, this course explores the purposes and effects of adaptation through a study of a variety of screen versions of adapted texts by authors including Jane Austen, Emily St. John Mandel, and Geoffrey Chaucer. Assigned readings include both literary texts and screen adaptations.",

By examining the sartorial—what, or whom, we wear—in literature and film, we consider the ramifications of style in discourses on race and gender. We study films, novels, and photography that focus on garments in ways that highlight the complex relationship among material histories, social fabrics, and notions of the corporeal and the human. Along the way, we unsettle the easy yet stubborn distinction between surface and interiority. From Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo to Wendell B. Harris’s Chameleon Street, Frederick Wiseman’s documentary of department stores to Lee Bul’s cyborg sculptures, this course asks: how does fashion constitute—or unravel—our notions of the self and of the world as \"surface\" activity?",

We aim to bring traditional philosophies, narratives, and histories of memory into conversation with both long established and cutting-edge research findings on the neuroscience of memory. Questions explored in the course include: What is memory and how does it work? How has memory been conceptualized over time in both culture and science? What are the various media through which we process memories, including collective and individual forms? What can we learn from moments of mnemonic failure? What new technologies of memory are on the horizon? How is our vision of the future influenced by the content and processes of memory? In wrestling with these questions, we encounter a wide selection of narratives, art objects, films, and scientific data. Students also have an opportunity to explore their own experiences in learning and memory (including experiential assignments, e.g., asking them to memorize certain things and report on the experience, as well as opportunities to reflect on their experiences of and access to forms of collective, communal memory).",

How does the genre negotiate the interplay between external and internal development, subjective and objective experience? What are the political implications of the form(s) these books take for questions of gender, class, and colonialism? How do the novels negotiate both space (local, national, international) and time (personal memory and public history)? How does the form alter over the course of the period in question?

How does narrative sequence impart political or moral implications? How do conventions of the novel form shape our experience of gender? What kind of being is a narrator? Likely authors include Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Laurence Sterne, Maria Edgeworth, Jane Austen, Jennifer Egan, Colson Whitehead, and Richard Powers.",

To deepen and enrich our reporting and interviewing, we discuss the more technical and stylistic elements present in strong non-fiction. As we read and write, we put these theoretical concerns into practice and play by writing two or three profiles about people you do not like, a place you don’t care for, an idea you oppose, or an object whose value eludes you. Your writing might be about someone who haunts you without your permission or whatever else gets under your skin, but ideally, your subject makes you uncomfortable, troubles you, and confounds you. Some examples of the writing that we read are Guy Debord, Lucille Clifton, C.L.R. James, Pascale Casanova, W.G. Sebald, Jayne Cortez, AbouMaliq Simone, Greg Tate, Annie Ernaux, Edward Said, Mark Twain, Jacqueline Rose, Toni Morrison, Julia Kristeva, and Ryszard Kapuscinski.",

We discuss the tensions between collective wisdom and individual reason in the early modern period and survey the thought of thinkers in the proto-liberal and proto-conservative traditions, such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke on sovereignty, individual autonomy, reason, and toleration; and Robert Filmer, Richard Hooker, and David Hume on order, custom, and utility. Our main object of inquiry, however, is the intellectual division that emerged between supporters and critics of the French Revolution, the historical event that prompted the modern political identities of liberalism and conservatism. Accordingly, we examine the political, moral, and economic theories of the Revolution; reactions to the Revolution from Edmund Burke, Joseph de Maistre, and other counterrevolutionaries; critical responses to their reactions, including those from Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, and James Mackintosh; and the impact of this debate on the evolution of liberalism and conservatism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Europe and the United States. Class discussions and readings confront liberal and conservative perspectives on human nature; reason; freedom; tradition; individual rights; religion; the Enlightenment; market economies; democratic participation; and equality.",

        "description": "We are living in a time of moral turmoil. Not only have legal rights we took for granted been overturned (e.g., the right to abortion), but we seem more polarized than ever. In this course, we take a careful and sober look at some of the moral and social controversies that constitute this state of turmoil and polarization. At the heart of the course are debates concerning conflicts between the following rights and values that people in liberal democracies see as sacrosanct, e.g., autonomy (e.g., bodily autonomy), freedom (e.g., free speech and freedom of association), harm prevention, the right to life, and well being. We start by exploring the fundamental theories in morality (e.g., Consequentialism, Deontology, and Rights Theory) and well-being (e.g., Hedonism, Desire-satisfaction, and Objective List views). We then use these theories to critically analyze particular moral and social controversies. In particular, we explore how these theories answer the following questions, \"Is abortion morally permissible?\", \"Is euthanasia morally wrong?\", \"Should there be limits on free speech? If so, when?\", \"Should there be limits on what can be bought and sold?\", \"Can the state be justified in interfering with who gets to parent children?\", \"How open should state borders be?\", \"What do we owe the global poor?\"",

The course starts with foundational work in relational ethics which connects ethics with moral accountability, e.g., moral demands, claims, blame, apology, forgiveness, etc. With a grasp of these views in place, we turn toward the morality of interpersonal relationships. Interpersonal relationships are a central part of our lives. As social creatures, they are essential for our well-being and the meaningfulness of our lives. But they raise important moral questions. For example, do we have special obligations to our friends, family, or co-national? Are we epistemically permitted to ignore evidence if it indicates that our friend or family has done something wrong? Is there a conflict between what morality requires and what is required for being a good friend or family member? What’s wrong or bad about being friends with an immoral person? We also explore psychological and moral aspects of these relationships, e.g., what does loving a person consist of? What reasons do we have to love others? Do we owe our loved ones debts of gratitude?",

Throughout, we analyze the interplay of economic incentives and realities with political behavior and institutions. We pay special attention not just to what we know, but also to how we know it, highlighting contemporary empirical research from political science and economics. Substantively, we cover a constellation of topics at the intersection of these two fields: the relationship of income inequality and wealth concentration to campaign finance, the role of education polarization in determining who runs for office, the legacy of slavery and its relationship to identity politics, and the links between racial, economic, and political segregation across neighborhoods. Other topics include social media and internet news–which receive much of the blame for polarization in the press–the (in)effectiveness of campaign advertising, the determinants of voter turnout, the impact of social movements, and the shifting alliances among business, labor, and the major political parties.",

We first identify provisions of the Constitution that relate to economics and familiarize ourselves with methods of constitutional interpretation, including originalism and living constitutionalism. We then apply this guiding framework to our analysis of key Supreme Court cases that have addressed the Commerce Clause, the Takings Clause, the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and a number of other constitutional provisions that relate to commercial exchange and the legal status of corporations. Additional concepts we discuss include the countermajoritarian difficulty, the rational basis test, strict scrutiny, substantive due process, fundamental rights, disparate impact, public accommodations law, antidiscrimination law, and antitrust law. The guiding question we confront is whether the courts should a.) defer to legislatures in regulating business actors; or b.) overturn democratically enacted laws to protect the economic liberties of individuals.",

We interrogate potential drivers—and the tools used to diagnose them—of some of Earth’s most severe extinctions, including the emergence of new species and new behaviors, meteorite impacts, volcanism, the configuration of tectonic plates, global warming and glaciation. Drawing upon a combination of scientific literature, popular science and works of fiction, we also discuss whether we are in the midst of a sixth mass extinction and explore predicted and imagined post-extinction landscapes.",

For students of (macro)evolution, geobiology, paleontology, and earth system science, a foundation in paleoecology is essential for understanding the dynamics and drivers of these interrelated systems. To this end, this course is designed to provide students with i) a basic literacy in core concepts of paleoecology, ii) deeper insights into a few major topics, and iii) basic analytical methods with which to ask and answer novel questions of the fossil record.",

Readings and discussions focus primarily on the British New Wave (from about 1979 to 1985) and K-Pop (1992-present), but we also discuss first-wave reggae, ska, rocksteady from the 1960s-70s, British and American punk rock music (1970s-1980s), the precursors of modern K-Pop, and have a brief discussion of Japanese City Pop. The class focuses mainly on the British New Wave and K-Pop because these two genres of popular music have strong ties to particular geographic areas, but they became or have become extremely popular in other parts of the world. We also investigate the importance of music videos in the development of these genres.",

        "description": "The borders that constitute the geographical divisions of the world are contingent, but they can have enormous ordering power in the lives of people and other beings. Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources (including goods, knowledge, information, technologies, etc.). Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that constrain the access of excluded persons to resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives. Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts that may include treatises, maps, travel literature, visual culture, material culture (e.g., currency), law, music, and performance art, students investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. More broadly, we explore, describe, and trace the entanglements of bordering, globalizations, and knowledge production in Hispanophone cultures. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are (social) borders and what are the processes through which they persist? How do the effects of practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? What can we learn from indigenous peoples’ responses to bordering process and globalization? \n\nThe course is conducted entirely in Spanish. Readings are available electronically through Canvas and the University Library. To be conducted in Spanish.",

We will consider how terms like \"women\" and \"men,\" \"femininity\" and \"masculinity,\" \"homosexuality\" and \"heterosexuality,\" and \"gender\" and \"transgender\" have structured people’s experiences and perceptions of bodies – their own and others’.  We will interrogate the dynamic and often contested relationship between \"gender\" and sexuality,\" and their constitution through other axes of power and difference, including race, class, and (dis)ability.",

This course takes a comparative approach to understanding how and why food is a central component of contemporary sovereignty discourse. More than just a question of eating, Indigenous foodways offer important critiques of, and interventions to, the settler state: food connects environment, community, public health, colonial histories, and economics. Students theorize these connections by reading key works from across the fields of critical indigenous studies, food studies, philosophy, history, and anthropology. In doing so, we question the potentialities of enacting food sovereignty within the settler state, whether dietary decolonization is possible in the so-called age of the Anthropocene, and the limits of working within and against today’s legacies of the colonial food system.",

The neologism combines \"refugee\" and \"futurisms\" to underscore both the limitations of existing frameworks about refugees and gestures toward emerging formulations and formations. Temporally, geographically, planetarily expansive and fluid, this course is inspired by the growing field of critical refugee studies and the rich traditions of Afro-futurism, Indigenous futurism, Asian futurism, and Latinx futurism. It draws on language, history, philosophy, theology, literature, art, and film to explore what it means to be human amid and in anticipation of different kinds of refuge-seeking futures.",

We examine the spread of Islam across the continent from the 7th century through trade, education, and jihad. Drawing primarily from anthropology, we explore the impact of faith on governance and social structures, as well as its interactions with other religious traditions on the continent. By the end of the course, students will: a) learn about key issues in the study of Islam in Africa, including Islam noir, Africanization of Islam, Ajami, and lived Islam, b) develop tools for studying how Africans on the continent and the diaspora practice Islam in various contexts and time periods, and c) acquire research skills for studying Islam ethnographically.",

With a special focus on the context of U.S. cities, students examine where a burgeoning informality is visible in the region’s everyday life. How planners and policymakers address informality is an important social justice challenge. But what is the informal sector, or urban informality, or the informal city? This class addresses such questions through a rigorous examination of the growing body of literature from Sociology, Latinx Studies, Urban Planning, and Geography. We reflect on the debates and theories in the study of informality in the U.S. and beyond and gain an understanding of the prevalence, characteristics, rationale, advantages and disadvantages, and socio-spatial implications of informal cities. More specifically, we examine urban informality in work—examining street vendors, sex workers, and waste pickers—as well as housing, and the built environment.",

This course looks at the unprecedented mobility of South Asians from the mid-19th century until now as merchants, indentured labor, students, pilgrims, professionals, domestic workers, political exiles, refugees, and economic migrants, through the lens of state attempts to control movement and individual resistance, subversion, and adaptation to such controls. Focusing on the legal consciousness of South Asian migrants and the emergence of South Asian nations as political players on the global stage, this class traces how South Asian mobility led to the forging of a new global order, over migration, multiculturalism, Islamic law, civil liberties, labor law, and international law.",

        "description": "This seminar examines the historical and ongoing entanglement of Indigenous women and Anglophone legal systems, moving from early medieval England to the Pacific and North America. We begin with Old English legal codes that governed women’s rights and social positions in early medieval English societies, questioning how these texts established gendered legal frameworks that later informed colonial legal structures. As we move geographically and temporally, we trace the ways British and American legal systems constructed Indigenous women as subjects of empire, shaping their legal status, kinship structures, and sovereignty. A central theme of the course is Indigenous women's resistance to settler legal impositions. Through case studies—including early colonial legal battles, the forced removals of women and children, and contemporary struggles for justice and land rights—we examine how Indigenous women have asserted legal and extralegal agency in the face of colonial authority.",

By the end of the course, participants will familiarize themselves with the crucial roles that religious beliefs and practices play in causing and responding to human mobilities. Students will also gain familiarity with the ways in which migrants' religious practices transform local cultures, politics, and societies as their own religious practices are reconfigured by and in the context of host nations.

From sending food scraps to pig farmers in the 1800’s, to responding to energy crises and crashes with infrastructure changes, to establishing early recycling programs in the 1980’s, the University’s work has deep roots, if not always the comprehensive impact some would desire. This course provides students with the opportunity to learn about this long history of effort to improve the University’s sustainability, and engage in the real act of change management in current efforts on campus. Exploring change management theory and learning from many on campus experts, students work in groups bringing a diversity of experiences and knowledge to the table to tackle real and wicked problems in our midst. In taking on these timely projects, students have the opportunity to tangibly impact Yale’s ongoing efforts to fully embrace sustainable operations while experiencing the friction, joy, disappointment, learning, and challenge that are all part of working to make real change happen in complex systems.",

Basic physics and paleoclimate agree that modern changes are enormous. SERIOUS: Impacts of 21st Century climate change on weather, drought, fires, famines, and floods pose the greatest threat to ecosystems in millions of years and the worst threat to the global economy since the Black Death. Worse, the changes are essentially permanent. SOLVABLE: Rapid and complete decolonization of the global energy system  is feasible and affordable, but politically difficult.

We look at era-defining classical films from Hollywood’s Golden Age to contemporary films and media to consider narratives of self-transformation. The course traces and interrogates conceptions of self and Other, person and thing that are summoned in cinematic visions of passing, self-improvement, restoration, and instant alteration. Some of the questions we ask are: What kind of labor does the makeover recognize and efface? What does it mean to make-over a self, a house, a genre, a people, a nation? How do we come to visualize such changes, and how do we know what it is we see? We watch films by Charlie Chaplin, Max Ophuls, Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock, Douglas Sirk, Billy Wilder, Bob Fosse, Martin Scorsese, Janicza Bravo, among others. We read critics and theorists such as Barbara Johnson, André Bazin, Stanley Cavell, Lauren Berlant, Anne Anlin Cheng, Joan Copjec, and Roland Barthes to conceptualize the Hollywood makeover’s connections to embodiment, sexuality, material objecthood, and racial difference. Along the way, we consider the visual lure and theoretical stakes of \"making it.\"",

Students analyze how films reconstruct memory, challenge hegemonic historiography, and reinscribe erased or silenced perspectives. The course reflects on the relevance of these works in contemporary struggles against violence and oppression, considering how they teach us to critically engage with power, resistance, and collective memory. It also focuses on women's cinematic productions and representations, examining how gender, race, and political resistance intersect in the visual representation of repression, violence, and memory. The course incorporates both Spanish and Portuguese, encouraging students to express their ideas and develop projects in either language. Languages: Portuguese and Spanish.",

        "description": "Landscape and the natural environment have never occupied \"background\" status in Italian film. Given the spectacular visual presence of its terrain—thanks to the relative proximity of mountain chains and the long seacoast—and given the pivotal importance of farming and pasturage in this traditionally agrarian economy, the synergy between the human and natural worlds has played a prominent role in Italian filmmaking since the very inception of the industry. Most recently, two developments have pushed this issue to the forefront of scholarly attention: the advent of ecocriticism, which found one of its earliest and most influential champions in Serenella Iovino, and the establishment of regional film commissions, grassroots production centers that sponsored cinematic works attuned to the specificity of \"the local.\" The course includes study of films that predate our current environmental consciousness, as well as recent films that foreground it in narrative terms. In the case of the older films, which have already attracted a great deal of critical commentary over time, we work to shift our interpretive frame in an \"eco-friendly\" direction (even when the films’ characters are hardly friends of the environment). Among the films considered are Le quattro volte, Il vento fa il suo giro, L’uomo che verrà, Gomorra, L’albero degli zoccoli, Riso amaro, Red Desert, Christ Stopped at Eboli, and Il ladro di bambini. We screen one film a week and devote our seminars to close analysis of the works in question.",

Beyond considering the role of major jazzmen and jazzwomen in films such as Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Charles Mingus, Benny Goodman, Thelonious Monks, Lena Horne, etc., we also analyze how jazz and African Americans are represented in Hollywood films featuring this music as a focal point or as musical accompaniment. Jazz music has served historically as a medium for early African-American presence in Hollywood films, via musical numbers and performances (Duke Ellington orchestra, the Nicholas Brothers, etc.), all while conforming to the demands of major film companies. During WWII, wartime films saw in jazz the opportunity to convey consent and support for the war (Birth of the Blues, Blues in the Night, Syncopation). By exploring films from the 1930s to the 1970s, and cross-examining essays by Paul Gilroy, Krin Gabbard, and others, this course calls into question these attempts and investigates the early silencing, instrumentalization, and reappropriation processes commonly characteristics of Hollywood. We contextualize this filmography by comparing it with films made by African-American film directors and analyzing their use of jazz music. The course illustrates how jazz music embodies a formal and political counter-power, evident through its themes and compositions, and demonstrates how films such as The Cry of Jazz, or The Connection capture this spirit.",

But if we were asked \"what does it sound like?\", we would probably be at a loss for words. Timbre, also known as \"color\" or \"sound quality,\" is possibly the most sensual and yet ungraspable aspect of musical sound.  It has often been treated as a \"wastebasket\" category, negatively defined as everything that is neither pitch, nor loudness. And yet, as timbre is one of the predominant features of much of the music composed since the middle years of the twentieth century in a variety of genres, it is time to root through the wastebasket and start putting things in order. Throughout the semester, drawing on a bibliography that spans musicology, ethnomusicology, music theory, music cognition, sound studies, and film studies, we develop an \"ear,\" a vocabulary, analytical techniques, and the cultural sensitivity necessary to identify and name timbral characteristics as effectively as possible. As notions of timbre are historically and geographically situated, so is our class: we consider music and sound across genres and media from the eighteenth century to the present, remaining mostly in the so-called Western world.",

While this phenomenon has been global to some degree, it has been by far the most pronounced in the United States. Driven by a sustained period of highly kinetic counterterrorism operations, the evolution of SOF has been one of the most significant developments in the military history of the 21st century. With that period of conflict now receding, and a period of sustained competition between near-peers dominating geopolitical dynamics, the role of SOF remains both contested and consequential. \n\n\nThe goal of this course is to prepare students to think critically about the proper utilization of SOF—whether as informed citizens, military leaders, or civilian policymakers. Drawing on a diverse set of narrative, historical, legal, and other sources, the course will analyze SOF’s recent expansion and explore what its future utilization might look like, based on the changing landscape of global conflict.",

The outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022 quickly became a flashpoint in the region. Over two years later, the stakes are high and tensions are rising among transatlantic allies supporting Ukraine, both with arms and sanctions. This course evaluates the historical roots of the war and the fallout from a potential failure to effectively deter an authoritarian state from invading a sovereign neighbor. Our course of study includes the role of international stakeholders and multi-lateral institutions in the conflict, regional political and security dynamics and economic consequences. The humanitarian aspects of the war and its impact on civilian populations, human rights violations and the role of the media in shaping perceptions of the conflict is analyzed. Ultimately, what are the responsibilities of the international community in mitigating the human cost of conflict and the broader economic and policy implications? The aim of this course is both a comprehensive understanding of the conflict and its role in changing and shaping both security and democracy in region and further afield.",

Our goal is to try to put ourselves in the shoes of US and Iranian decision-makers, internalize their respective narratives and assessments of the past, and seek to understand why each sees acts toward the other as they do. We focus in particular on the two nations’ sense of (in)security, Iran’s and the US’s regional roles and ties to Mideast state and non-state actors, the nuclear question and nuclear negotiations, as well as the role and impact of US sanctions. The course will closely follow unfolding events and examine possible future scenarios in light of these historical lessons.

These questions are as old as the United States itself, and the debate continues to rage today. This course examines these questions through the lens of the United States' recent engagements in the Middle East, focusing on the First Gulf War, the War on Terror, the Second Gulf War, Libya, Syria, Iran, Israel/Palestine, and the Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, and Oman as well as Ukraine/Russia.  We consider whether the U.S. approach in each case was effective, not effective, or partly effective, and what factors contributed to that outcome. The factors we examine include but are not limited to U.S. security, business and economic interests, and human rights.",

        "description": "This seminar examines the challenges that must be addressed when the fighting has stopped. Once a peace agreement is signed, real deal-making begins. Former rebels negotiate with their military commanders about relinquishing arms and working for a living; communities look for \"peace dividends,\" refugees weigh options to return home; Governments try to assert authority despite how weakened they have become or new to the role they are; compatriots who opposed the peace settlement relentlessly try to undermine it. The international community, which often leads warring parties to the table, takes on a new role also, informing and sometimes deforming outcomes. Building a durable peace requires a sensitivity to the changing priorities of the signatories and international community, as well as the constituencies for whom the peace was achieved. Anchored in (but not limited to) the ongoing UN-supported peace agreement implementation process in Mali and the monitoring process of the Final Agreement to End Armed Conflict and Build a Stable and Lasting Peace in Colombia, the seminar considers peace-building processes from the perspectives of formerly warring parties, diplomats, NGOs, and civil society, providing students an opportunity to begin to catalogue strategies for building durable peace following conflict.",

Instead, we will ask what it means to rank literature in the first place, as our class takes a closer look at some the different measures by which books can be made subject to a ranking—for example: sales numbers, expert opinion, and critical acclaim, or success through translation and adaptation. We study the different ways of awarding book prizes and curating lists of literature. Additionally, we study the circumstances that lead to literary \"hypes,\" including Netflix adaptations, BookTok, and the author-as-celebrity. We read novels and excerpts of novels by some of the New York Times’ top-ranked authors, as well as by Nobel Prize laureates of recent years, and compare the different modes of selection and the benefits as well as biases inherent to the respective lists. We also look at currently circulating lists of \"banned books\" and the works of literature banned from official reading lists and syllabi to understand another aspect of the politics behind the curation of lists. We close our literary journey with a text by author Toni Morrison who, curiously, made all three lists.",

Students explore fairy tales by Wilhelm Hauff and Ludwig Bechstein, as well as traditional cultural theories of the German fairy tale, psychoanalytic and pedagogical interpretive approaches, and contextualization of this genre in cultural and social history. The focus is on the role that the literary fairy tale played in German culture throughout history and the impact German fairy tales still have today.",

How did we reach this critical point, and how can we move forward? We examine Germany’s longstanding environmental history from the 1900s to the present, including global initiatives and solutions. We discuss endeavors of the 1960s and 70s social justice movements, including alternative lifestyles, anti-nuclear protests, and the rise of the Green Party, but also explore topics such as the 21st-century Energiewende (energy transition), renewables, factory farming, bioethics, consumerism, housing, as well as the concepts of circularity and degrowth, sustainable banking, and fossil fuels and wars. We include local events, such as Yale's Environmental Film Series.

        "description": "The Frankfurt School of Critical Theory was (is) a group of eclectic interdisciplinary Marxist philosophers and social scientists, active from the 1920s to the present. Most were German Jews born around the turn of the 20th century. The Frankfurt school were a group of thinkers in almost perpetual exile. Simultaneously critical of American capitalism and of Soviet Communism, they were expelled from their native Germany in the wake of Hitler’s rise to power. They also often lacked any intellectual safe haven, finding themselves at odds much philosophical and social-scientific orthodoxy (positivism, neo-Kantianism, \"value-free\" social science etc.). The critical theorists of the Frankfurt School sought to re-actualize ideas from the philosophical tradition, especially from Kant and Hegel, in order to address the complex realities of modern society: mass culture; fascism, totalitarianism and authoritarianism; world war; imperialism; secularization; irrationality, sexuality and aggression; and so on. This class looks at critical theory from a philosophical perspective, focusing on its claim to fuse traditional philosophy and radical social science.",

        "description": "The crisis of language predates the invention of ChatGPT (who may or may not have helped write this syllabus). This course delves into the concept of language crises and its long history from a philosophical and literary perspective, examining how crises of language are represented in literature and how they reflect broader philosophical questions about language, identity, and power. We explore different philosophical approaches to language, such as the history of language and philology (Herder, Humboldt, Nietzsche), structuralism and post-structuralism (Saussure), analytical and pragmatic philosophies (Wittgenstein), phenomenology and deconstruction (Heidegger), and analyze how these theories shape our understanding of language while simultaneously evoking its crisis. The course also examines how such language crises are represented and produced in literature and the arts; how authors and artists approach the complexities of language loss, and how crises help birth alternative systems of signification. Through close readings of literary texts by Hofmannsthal, Musil, Bachmann, et. al., we analyze the symbolic and metaphorical significance of language crises, as well as the ethical and political implications of language loss for (cultural) identity. Experimental use of language such as DaDa artwork, performance cultures, and \"Sprachspiel\" poetry by the \"Wiener Gruppe,\" as well as contemporary KI/AI literature, further complement the theoretical readings. By exploring language crises through the lens of philosophy and literature, we gain a deeper understanding of the role of language—and its many crises—in shaping our understanding of ourselves and our communities.",

Reading across these texts, we ask: how did the Greeks think about the causes of diseases? How did they diagnose illness? How did they divide responsibility for illness  between gods, doctors, and patients? What role did plague and healing occupy in civic life? Alongside this thematic study, the course also offers a structured review of Greek morphology and syntax. This course is a bridge course, which is designed to transition students from L4 to L5 and which bestows L5 credit upon completion.",

Instead, these works frustrate not only a wholistic reading of Greece as a unified and coherent social construct, but also the physical or aesthetic pleasure of its landscape and its ‘quaint’ people with their insistence on grotesque, violent, or otherwise disturbing images or themes (incest, sexual otherness and violence, aggression, corporeality, and xenophobia).

The second book, Sea of Poppies is the first novel in his epic trilogy on the Indian Ocean, which traces the journey of a diverse group people from the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia and China during the nineteenth century. This seminar breaks out of conventional regional fields by closely following historical actors on the ground. Each session explores several core themes for historical research namely commerce, mobility, labor, climate, cosmopolitanism, colonialism, and modernization.",

Questions about reproduction–and about not reproducing–are deeply tied to questions of gendered and racial rights; of bodily autonomy; of American expansion and empire; and of who counts as a citizen, or even as a human being. In the past few years, we’ve encountered new stories about everything from new and restrictive abortion laws, to immigrant woman who were sterilized without their consent, to new technologies in male birth control, to the inequitable childcare burden that falls to women during times of hardship, to the racist roots of foster care and residential school systems. In this course, we come to understand the historical changes in American reproduction to better understand the complicated roots of our current moment. By analyzing articles in newspapers and scientific journals, advertisements, film, patient and physician narratives, and exhibitions and material culture, students will understand reproduction as a site for empowerment and activism, as a site of medical professionalization, and as a site of health disparity. We examine reproduction capaciously, including pregnancy and childbirth, birth control and abortion, assistive reproductive technologies, and adoption and foster care. Our analysis is intersectional, and we consider what different identities meant for reproduction historically, as well as in our current moment.",

We consider in what way these phenomena served as historical ruptures, and in what other ways we see continuities threaded across the centuries and across diverse locales. At the same time, we learn how vibrant this world was, where political configurations changed and developed, intellectuals battled with essential questions about the nature of God, and the fundaments of the modern world were laid. We consider these subjects and many more in considering both the creative and diverse medieval world, and the ways in which scholars conceptualize its different aspects.",

Likewise, it problematizes the notion that the medieval legal tradition either lacked innovation or was rendered obsolete by colonial reforms and modernist critique. It approaches Islamic law through the speculative enterprise of jurisprudence (fiqh), the work of legal scholars to elaborate God’s most likely position regarding any legal dilemma. Through the literature and opinions (fatwās) of legal specialists from the ninth through the twentieth century, the class interrogates the relationship between change and continuity in Islamic law. We explore how jurisconsults balanced the doctrine of trans-regional schools of law with the local dilemmas faced by the communities in which they lived and served. Similarly, we consider not only the opportunities but also the risks that arise from adapting Islamic law to local conditions. The course challenges students to ask what is change within a tradition? In the debates and polemics of legal scholars, we contemplate the appeal and the limitations of reform within Islamic law, tracing how both have been contested and have evolved across different geographies and periods in the Muslim World. Likewise, we rethink the boundaries of continuity. We question how a legal school and a legal canon are constructed and revised, examining the ways in which both are capable of reinforcing – or imperiling – the Islamic legal tradition. Last, we explore the endurance of Islamic law in contemporary Muslim societies. The course reflects on the processes and the consequences of various projects of \"modernizing\" the Sharīʿa, asking how the institutions of the colonial and postcolonial state have reconfigured Islamic law in radically different ways.",

However, this stereotype does not reflect the remarkable economic and political development over the last few decades. While social, legal, political, and economic factors vary within and between the countries of the region, since the 1980s, many countries that faced authoritarian regimes transitioned to democracy; Most children in the region now have access to healthcare and attend school; The subcontinent is at the center of the climate justice agenda while dealing with new forms of colonialism from the \"Global North\"; Latin America is pioneering women’s inclusion in politics, parity policies, and legal landmarks to combat gender-based political violence; Latin American feminism, queer activism, and movements advocating for the rights of black people, indigenous communities, and environmental protection are vibrant and have achieved pivotal accomplishments. Still, some governance challenges persist, and new ones have emerged.",

Nowhere is this more salient than in Latin America, a region with geographic proximity to the United States. This seminar explores the relations between the United States and Latin America, from the rise of nation states in the nineteenth century to present-day conflicts, providing an overview of the most relevant issues that shaped the history of both regions, emphasizing themes like capitalism, imperialism, and resistance. The course shows how key Latin American actors, institutions, and resources shaped the development of the United States as the dominant hegemonic power in the twentieth century. We begin in the nineteenth century, when both regions began to create alliances to combat the presence of European powers in the hemisphere. Then, we examine how US economic and military presence in Latin America was both welcomed and contested by different social sectors in both regions. We also emphasize how the Cold War dictated US strategy in the region, resulting in coups and revolutions, and how Latin America played a fundamental role in US foreign policy. This seminar exposes students to different historiographical debates about American imperialism, tracing how different scholars have characterized the unique relationship between the US and Latin America.",

Students collaboratively build an archive of reproductive health histories in New Haven. This archive will be a site of academic interest, developed in response to community needs as we consider how to leverage historical research to imagine a better future. The first unit provides students with targeted methodological training in oral historical and traditional archival methods in preparation of the collection of oral histories and compilation of paper archives. The remainder of the seminar engages these methods in project work. Students use their training to build a publicly accessible reproductive health archive housed at Yale, to develop their own research questions coming out of this nascent archive, and to support New Haven organizations that can use these histories to serve their communities.",

In addition to investigating the definition of medical technology, also consider a range of themes and questions, among them: why do some technologies succeed and others fail? What is the relationship between medical technology and power? How do race, class, gender, and sexuality impact the creation and use of medical technology? We pay particular attention to the themes of expertise, authority, and identity. In addition to reading primary and secondary sources, students work closely with materials from the Medical Historical Library. Students can expect to emerge from the course prepared to analyze medical technologies and place them in historical context in American medicine.

From calls for decolonization and repatriation to protests over human remains collections and unethical donor policies, museums and related cultural institutions find themselves at a crossroads, reckoning with their violent colonial histories while handling ongoing concerns about workers’ rights, systemic inequality, and their role in shaping knowledge in the public sphere. Whether addressing climate change policy, Black Lives Matter protests, fights for unionization, or Indigenous representation, it’s clear that museums are rich sites for critique in the history of science and beyond. How did we get here, and where do we go from here? Beginning with early modern cabinets of curiosity and moving through nineteenth century encyclopedic museums, controversial anatomical collections, and more recent natural history institutions, we investigate how museum politics and power produce knowledge, from the depths of their archives to sensationalized exhibits while questioning what an ethical, holistic museum might look like in the future. Amidst ongoing debates over controversial collections like the Benin Bronzes, human remains stored in universities across the United States, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 2023 admission of looting practices, and the American Museum of Natural History’s shallow apology for its eugenic past, the role of museums has expanded beyond the bounds of the academy, stoking universal struggles around human rights, international repatriation policies, and the politics of preservation, display, and loss. We bridge the classroom and the collection, visiting institutions around New Haven, practicing skills like provenance research and ethical handling of difficult objects while working towards a practice-based final project that suggests ways forward for museums and collections.",

        "description": "This seminar is dedicated to the reality and the perception of the night across time and in different cultures. We explore how religious and philosophical beliefs, political and economic forces, changes in technologies of lighting, human biology, and the shift from rural to urban and agrarian to industrial societies affected attitudes toward time in general and the night in particular. These changes influenced the perceptions, uses, and the ways different groups experienced nocturnal time, and how we act, sleep, work, interact, and even dream. The traditional binary view of day and night is questioned by presenting a more complex \"and dynamic face\" of the night. Nightfall provides multiple opportunities for dissent and rebellion and becomes an ideal space for marginal and subordinate people. Historical analysis, literary texts, medical and scientific writings, and primary sources provide the class with a cross-disciplinary approach to examine how the night became the abode of the ghost, the devil, the witch, and the dead, and how the night became criminalized, commercialized and even politicized. In our time, improvements in lighting changed the nocturnal world, but also had detrimental effects on sleep and dreams, and caused contemporary movements–aesthetic and scientific–to \"rescue\" the night.",

As a form of historical writing, microhistories allow us to delve deeply into a seemingly narrow subject in order to shed light on much larger themes. In this course, we use microhistories to examine the 17th- and 18th-century British Atlantic world as a space of immense wealth and violence, of expansion and dispossession, of cooperation and competition. Above all, it was a world of entanglements, in which peoples of the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe became drawn together in unprecedented ways. Throughout the course, students work to develop their own microhistories which explore these topics.",

Are there types of truth that any regime would—or should—find dangerous? What are the possible motives and pathways for self-censorship?  We begin with the revolt of the Hebrews against polytheistic Egypt and the Socratic questioning of democracy, and end with various contemporary cases of censorship within and between regimes.

        "description": "Francis of Assisi is undoubtedly one of the most important figures in European history. As one of Catholicism’s most revered saints (often considered to be the greatest male saint ever), his radical message of voluntary poverty, humility and fraternity significantly revived the Catholic church in a moment of profound crisis, and has since been accepted as one of the foundational elements of European thought, receiving universal admiration from diverse thinkers who are often unaffiliated with the Catholic tradition. This course seeks to take both challenges head on. Its pedagogical intent is three-fold. First, by offering a comprehensive overview of the layered accumulation of narratives that has given us the Francis figure so beloved today, it encourages students to examine the ambiguous boundaries of \"reliability\" with regard to historical narratives, especially those with a mythopoetic flavor. Other than the well-known \"Little Flowers\", students are also exposed to less-known \"lives\" of the saint and are expected to critically compare these sources. Second, students are invited to Socratically wrestle with Francis’ spiritual legacy in light of its obvious conflict with prevalent notions of the \"good life\" in contemporary America. Third, students will gain a robust understanding of the Franciscan tradition which has left its footprint in vast regions outside of Europe (Jerusalem, East Asia, the Americas), has generated an important school of theology, and continues to stoke prominent public debates through controversial modern figures such as Padre Pio. Background readings on medieval religious history will also be provided. Topics will include orthodoxy and heresy, factional conflict within religious orders, missionary activities, mysticism, female religious life, and faith and the visual arts.",

Class readings underscore how Holocaust memory has changed over time, including how it belatedly became an event primarily about the genocide of European Jewry. We read histories, testimonies, and work on the relationship between the historical memories of the Holocaust and of European Imperialism.",

Throughout the semester, we consider a controversial question: is it possible to understand the history of art and science as a more-than-human story? Challenging traditional narratives of human progress, we attend to episodes of invention and destruction in equal measure. We discuss how art history is inseparable from histories of extracted resources, exploited species, environmental catastrophe, racialized and gendered understandings of the ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, and politicized understandings of land as power. At the same time, we explore how makers across cultures approached the natural world as a locus of the divine, a source of inspiration, and the ground for both scientific inquiry and the pursuit of self-knowledge. The very notions of art and artistic creation are impossible to define without recourse to nature as both a concept and a site of lived experience.",

In the first part, we examine the establishment of colonial medicine in British India, colonial interventions during plague visitations, and approaches to famine and food in the 19th century. We explore how science in colonial India was intertwined with anticolonialism, and examine anticolonial arguments against famines using modern economic sciences. In the second part, we explore pluralist practices of medicine in colonial South Asia and analyze how diverse approaches of colonial Indian medical practitioners blur the categories of \"traditional\" and \"modern\" medicine. We then focus on colonial and postcolonial public health interventions—including, regulating poisons and adulterated food, population control, and vaccination campaigns—and their contestations. In the final part, we focus on the postcolonial state and explore how scientific nationalism shaped the postcolonial state’s approaches to modernization and development. We examine how Indian physicists and surgeons created and maintained knowledge networks using alliances on both sides of Cold War rivalries.\"",

Unpacking the body’s role as a site of power in imperial, nationalist, and postcolonial politics, we investigate how our narratives of history deepen when we make questions of race, caste, gender, sexuality, and disability central to our narratives. To understand some of the vast array of embodied practices under empire and in new national states, we consider the perspectives of multi-disciplinary scholars across a series of themes like violence, labor, war, and health. Together, we work to foster ethical engagement with historical subjects and to understand the lasting legacies of embodied histories on the social and political worlds of South Asia today.",

For that matter, how did science come to be the right tool for defining and knowing sex, gender, and sexuality at all? How does that history influence our collective lives in the present, and what are some alternatives? This course gives students a background in the development of sex science, from evolutionary arguments that racialized sexual dimorphism to the contemporary technologies that claim to be able to get at bodily truths that are supposedly more real than identity. It introduces scholarly and political interventions that have attempted to short-circuit the idea that sex is stable and knowable by science, highlighting ways that queer and queering thinkers have challenged the stability of sexual categories. It concludes by asking how to put those interventions into practice when so much of the fight for queer rights, autonomy, and survival has been rooted in categorical recognition by the state, and by considering whether science can be made queer.",

The two-term essay takes the form of a substantial article, not longer than 12,500 words (approximately forty to fifty double-spaced typewritten pages). This is a maximum limit; there is no minimum requirement. Length will vary according to the topic and the historical techniques employed. Students writing the two-term senior essay who expect to graduate in May enroll in HIST 495 during the fall term and complete their essays in HIST 496 in the spring term. December graduates enroll in HIST 495 in the spring term and complete their essays in HIST 496 during the following fall term; students planning to begin their essay in the spring term should notify the senior essay director by early December. Each student majoring in History must present a completed Statement of Intention, signed by a department member who has agreed to serve as adviser, to the History Department Undergraduate Registrar by the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Blank statement forms are available from the History Undergraduate Registrar and in the Senior Essay handbook. Students enrolled in HIST 495 submit to the administrator in 237 HGS a two-to-three-page analysis of a single primary source, a draft bibliographic essay, and at least ten pages of the essay by the deadlines listed in the Senior Essay Handbook. Those who meet these requirements receive a temporary grade of SAT for the fall term, which will be changed to the grade received by the essay upon its completion. Failure to meet any requirement may result in the student’s being asked to withdraw from HIST 495. Students enrolled in HIST 496 must submit a completed essay to 211 HGS no later than 5 p.m. on the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Essays submitted after 5 p.m. will be considered as having been turned in on the following day. If the essay is submitted late without an excuse from the student's residential college dean, the penalty is one letter grade for the first day and one-half letter grade for each of the next two days past the deadline. No essay that would otherwise pass will be failed because it is late, but late essays will not be considered for departmental or Yale College prizes. All senior departmental essays will be judged by members of the faculty other than the adviser. In order to graduate from Yale College, a student majoring in History must achieve a passing grade on the departmental essay.",

        "description": "Photos are windows onto known and unknows places; they are an inseparable part of how we see and understand the world. In the age of Instagram, smartphones, and #Filter-#NoFilter we are all photographers, our very own curators of visual microcosms. We produce and consume photographic images almost constantly. We are now simultaneously master, subject, and audience in a transnational consumerist visual culture. This is remarkable seeing as the technology of photography has only been around for the past 180 years. No one could have foreseen the selfie as a potential technological application. The advent of photography in 1839 as a means of visual knowledge production was entangled with the rise of modern disciplines of ordering and categorizing knowledge about both people and places. Going beyond looking at photography merely as a technology invented in and disseminated from Europe, this course attempts to analyze \"other histories\" of photography, by looking at how this global technology was appropriated locally in Asia, Africa and the Americas. It is thus a global social history of the technology of photography. This course endeavors to give students the tools to analyze photos contextually, materially, and in terms of their content by looking at the first sixty years of photography. Specifically, this course looks at the intertwined histories of early photography and the formulation of modern disciplines by focusing on how early non-European anthropologists, geographers, and archaeologists incorporated photography in their methods of picturing place and the populace. Through thematic analysis and examination of different types of archival photos, students learn how to analyze photos both in the larger context of other visual sources, such as paintings, as well as textual sources.",

By analyzing methodologies like classification, conservation, and scientific communication, we will discuss how divisions between the \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" were created in western cultures along unequal ideas about human bodies. Critical analyses of sources across multiple disciplines will inform conversations about knowledge production with the goal of interrogating how these power structures have silenced voices and enacted long-lasting violences on both environments and the peoples inhabiting them. Using both primary and secondary sources while conducting original research, students will learn how binary and reductive categories have been used and abused in colonial science and beyond. This class will include visits to museums around Yale’s campus and beyond, with two of your assignments focused on the Peabody Museum.",

This course seeks to answer the question, what constitutes the right? What are the central philosophical, religious, and pagan, principles of those groups associated with this designation? How have the core ideas of the right changed over time? We do this by examining primary tracts written by theologians, political philosophers, and social theorists as well as secondary literature written by scholars interrogating movements associated with the right in America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. Though touching on specific national political parties, institutions, and think tanks, its focus is on mapping the intellectual overlap and differences between various right-wing ideologies. While the course is limited to the modern period, it adopts a global perspective to better understand the full scope of right-wing politics.",

This reading–and writing–intensive course surveys the global history of capitalism since the end of the eighteenth century, covering both the details of economic change and its interaction with society, culture, and politics. Students learn how capitalism has changed from the cotton mills of the nineteenth century to the cryptocurrency exchanges of the twenty-first; how its effects have been felt and interpreted in different ways around the world; and how historians employ a range of methodological approaches and sources to make sense of this history. Key themes include economic ideas; technological change; the tension between global interconnection and everyday life; and how both critics and champions have understood capitalism’s relationship to social justice and personal freedom.",

        "description": "This global introductory course surveys the interrelation of nature and art from antiquity to the present. Throughout the semester, we consider a controversial question: is it possible to understand the history of art and science as a more-than-human story? Challenging traditional narratives of human progress, we attend to episodes of invention and destruction in equal measure. We discuss how art history is inseparable from histories of extracted resources, exploited species, environmental catastrophe, racialized and gendered understandings of the ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, and politicized understandings of land as power. At the same time, we explore how makers across cultures approached the natural world as a locus of the divine, a source of inspiration, and the ground for both scientific inquiry and the pursuit of self-knowledge. The very notions of art and artistic creation are impossible to define without recourse to nature as both a concept and a site of lived experience.",

Traveling across the spectrum of its divergent meanings—novelty, ingenuity, unconventionality, distinctiveness, authenticity, fundamentality, fidelity—we will track how originality came to be a desideratum of modern subjects, and how \"originals\" came to be their proper object of study and love. We will also consider how appeals to the elsewhere and erstwhile have buttressed the concept, reinforcing the presumed priority of a European center against a peripheral rest-of-the-world supposedly under its influence. Is originality a value to defend, or is it a resource claimed by some and denied to others? How have our increasingly sophisticated technical capacities for reproduction, replication, and most recently, generation, tested our intuitions about originality? Facing a seeming infinity of sources, as well as their forceful algorithmic channeling, what is original work today? Themes include: authorship and authenticity, sources and influence, anachronism and pseudomorphism, seriality, reproduction, appropriation and citation, style and similitude.",

While this period is celebrated for its artistic, cultural, and intellectual achievements, it also had its fair share of intrigue, corruption, and moral complexities. Through love poems, secret letters, intricate networks, and political conspiracies, the course paints a vivid picture of the social and cultural landscape of Renaissance and early modern Italy. We look at the complex figure of Michelangelo, both as an artist and poet, focusing on his queer relationship with Tommaso de’ Cavalieri and his friendship with Vittoria Colonna. We then discuss how Renaissance art, often commissioned by powerful individuals–such as Isabella D’Este’s patronage of Leonardo da Vinci–was used to promote political or social agendas. We examine the alliances, betrayals, and murders that took place in Renaissance courts and how they shaped the political arena. Topics include the assassination of Lorenzo de’ Medici’s brother, Caterina de’ Medici’s agency, and Borgia’s rise to power as well as the use of poison as a political instrument in power struggles and schemes to eliminate rivals. The course highlights radical and sharp-witted women writers, such as Moderata Fonte and Arcangela Tarabotti, who protested against a patriarchal society, and gave voice to those who challenged gender norms. By uncovering these compelling narratives through the intersection of literature, religion, history, art, and sexuality, the course offers a more nuanced and critical view on this acclaimed era. This course counts as language across the curriculum (LxC).",

All subsequent deadlines are also strict, including for the project outline and bibliography, complete essay draft, and the final essay itself. Failure to comply with any deadline will be penalized by a lower final grade, and no late essay will be considered for a prize in the department. Senior essay workshops meet periodically throughout the term and are also mandatory. Permission may be given to write a two-term essay after consultation with the student's adviser and the DUS. Only those who have begun to do advanced work in a given area and whose project is considered to be of exceptional promise are eligible. The requirements for the one-term senior essay apply to the two-term essay, except that the essay should be 50-60 pages in length.",

The workshop events are structured around the schedule for the fall-to-spring two-term senior project, but students writing one-term projects or spring-to-fall projects also benefit from them, and there is at least one peer review session to support their key deadlines each semester too. Students completing their senior project in the same semester as the workshop have to share their key findings with peers in a celebratory discussion of key ideas, findings, and processes. Students may take both the Fall and the Spring workshop or select the semester that best helps them complete the SP.",

What is the thread that connects the Jedi knights of Star Wars and those that sat around king Arthur’s round table? How did medieval history and Renaissance poetry inform the expanded universes of superhero movies and fantasy literature, along with the inexhaustible fan-fiction that further extends and queers them? Chivalry, as a code of conduct and a network of symbols, inspired some of the most entertaining stories of the so-called Western canon, blurring the divide between high and popular culture. It offered storytellers (and nerds) of all ages a set of norms to question, bend, and break—especially in terms of gender. It challenged the very format of books, re-defining for good concepts like literary irony, seriality, and inter-mediality. This seminar proposes six pretty good trans-historical archetipes of fictional knights, combining iconic figures such as Marvel’s Iron Man and Italo Calvino’s Agilulfo, Ludovico Ariosto’s Bradamante and Game of Thrones’ Brienne of Tarth, Don Quixote and the Mandalorian. By analyzing together their oaths, weapons, armors, and destinies we aim to develop reading and writing skills to tackle any text, from epic and scholarship to TV-shows and comic-books.",

The history of murder, violence, and criminal investigation is as old as humankind. Yet, crime is not always considered evil, nor is evil always associated with crime. In this course, we discuss how the way evil was perceived and crime was punished has changed throughout history. From mythical accounts of murders, to real records of trials of humans, animals, and even objects accused of homicide or witchcraft, we analyze how aspects of social status or gender played a role in shaping punishment across Eastern and Western civilizations. We compare codified-law civilizations to those in which custom, social pressure, and community ethics determined correct behavior. Four historical cold cases with accompanying evidence are presented for in-class debate, and… perhaps students may be able to help solve an old mystery! At the end of the semester, we recreate historical trials using the same crime, evidence, and participants, but following the law and procedures of each one of the historical settings covered in this course. Will the verdict and sentence be any different? Friday sessions alternate between writing workshops and field trips to Yale collections.",

The course explores the expression in these works of philosophical stances of their times on the human subject and human society, bringing to bear writings contemporary to them as well as from more recent times. Readings include works of Ficino, Descartes, Rousseau, Wollstonecraft, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Douglass, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, and Adorno.

        "description": "It is generally agreed that modern political science begins with Machiavelli, but what that means remains a subject of considerable dispute.  What were Machiavelli’s accomplishments?  Was he a political realist who taught us to seek for \"the effectual truth\" of things?  Was he an advisor to princes or, at the very least, powerful executives who taught the importance of acting by \"oneself alone\"?  Was he a populist who sought to reanimate a taste for Roman-style republicanism?  Or did he seek to bring about a new kind of expansive territorial state fuelled by war and the desire for empire?  Machiavelli’s influence has been widespread throughout the modern world.  But just because his writings have been used and misused for a range of causes does not mean that we cannot discover an intelligible and coherent core to his work. We read Machiavelli’s two most important works of political theory–the Prince and the Discourses on Livy. The latter is read along with the Roman historian Titus Livy who was Machiavelli’s major source for his theories of political conflict, leadership, and liberty. We then consider his influence on some selected nineteenth and twentieth-century political theorists who have appropriated him as the central figure of modernity. Throughout the course we are attentive to the interpretive and methodological issues at stake in the recovery of the thought of this great Florentine political thinker.",

We address these questions in a global sense as much as we can: while the culture of Western modernity will figure very prominently in the readings and discussion, we take a more enlarged perspective, with some of the readings being about, and/or from, places and imaginaries beyond the West: China, Afrofuturism, and South Asia. Readings consist mostly of imaginative literary works (short stories, and excerpts from longer novels), but also encompasses some non-fiction and graphic fiction. At least two weeks of class also focuses on non-textual culture (theater, film, paintings, and music that is connected to AI). The readings combine with assignments involving both traditional essays (midterm essay and final essay) and short assignments (assigned on a rolling basis, which let students explore the questions addressed in the course to a further extent).",

What might an AI-induced shift in how we manipulate information, generate sound, create visual art (both still and moving images), and tell stories signify in the realm of culture, and what might it portend for our sense of who we are in the world? How should we situate AI, when viewed through the lens of culture at large, within the story of modernity? While the recent uproar concerning large language models (LLMs) in AI is only two years old, AI as a field has, however, existed for almost seventy years now. This course looks at AI and explore its relation with culture in a threefold way: through (i) historicizing (by looking at the historical cultural conditions that enabled or facilitated certain habits of thought or régimes of truth that led to present-day AI); (ii) analogizing (by tracing the similarities between patterns of expression in culture and developments in AI); and (iii) contextualizing (tracing how cultural artifacts have influenced AI’s directions and vice versa). The course’s orientation towards AI is critical, interpretive and analytical.",

We will examine how science functions both as a form of modern myth-making and as a mode of experience with profound cognitive and ethical dimensions. Often marked by irony and whimsy, the narratives we study engage with imagined technological futures, portrayals of the posthuman, and the ethical responsibilities of scientists. These literary works are exemplary in the way they define the multifaceted relationship between science and literature, resulting in innovative and influential experiments in narrative form. Our discussion will include critical texts by authors such as Italo Svevo, Dino Buzzati, Italo Calvino, Primo Levi, Leonardo Sciascia, and Daniele Del Giudice. The course will be conducted in English, and all required texts are available in English translation.",

        "description": "This seminar locates the intriguing, anxiety-inducing figure of the castrato at the nexus of fact and fiction, working to disentangle the historical realities of castrato lives from fantasies (both popular and scholarly) about castrato bodies, voices, and sexualities. Though the practice of castration has a long and complicated global history, the Italian term castrato denotes a particular group of people within that history: the many thousands of Italian boys, mostly from poor families, who were subjected to surgery between 1550 and 1850 with the express purpose of altering their voices for music-making. As the most celebrated performers of vocal music in early modern Europe, castrati were adored, worshipped, and heaped with wealth—but also mocked, shunned, and denied basic human rights. These and other contradictions characterize the castrato’s fraught place within music history, while also resonating across time with twenty-first-century concerns about constructions of gender, sexuality, race, class, and (dis)ability.",

We investigate how these texts reveal, critique, reimagine, or participate in the power relations of multiethnic societies founded on conquest, colonization, and slavery. Among our objectives is the development of the skills of critical analysis of texts written in Spanish, which we pursue through class discussion, oral presentations, and written and creative projects.",

In this course, we dive into the unexpected connections between Asia and Latin America, tracing stories of migration, cultural fusion, and artistic exchange from colonial encounters to today’s global pop culture. Our travels take us from early modern Japan, India, and the Philippines to today’s Cuba, Brazil, Peru, and Argentina, with several other stops along the way. Through literature, film, music, and anime, we explore how Asian diasporas shaped, and were shaped by, the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking worlds. Readings include Jorge Luis Borges, Cristina García, Chen Li, Augusto Higa Oshiro, Octavio Paz, Adriana Lisboa, and José Watanabe, among others. All materials are in English, with optional readings in Spanish and Portuguese for those interested in the original texts. Taught in English.",

His corpus includes gift-tags, commemorations of public monuments, odes to patrons, and praise and blame of a shifting set of emperors. For some institutions – such as the Roman baths – Martial is our only substantial source of evidence in Latin literature. In reading his short poems, we can build a detailed picture of everyday Roman life, one poem at a time. From an aesthetic perspective, though, Martial presents a challenge. How do we read the work en masse of an author devoted to the fleeting, ephemeral, and small?",

Through close readings of Latin texts, the class will examine how the Romans exploited their natural surroundings not only as physical resources, but as resources for human thought.  The focus will be on how ancient thinkers, living lives that were largely city-bound and detached from nature, structured their thoughts about the lives they lived (and about human existence more generally) by reference to their nonhuman surroundings: creatures, plants and places, some of which existed in the real world (in places far off, largely unknown and elsewhere; in places penetrated, explored, and/or told of), others of which existed entirely in the imagination, whether as inherited lore, or as places and creatures invented ad hoc by individuals and groups to get certain kinds of cultural work done.  We will look not only at the how and what, but at the why of nature’s encoding via culture, and vice versa (their symbiosis), paying special attention to conceptions of man and nature, natural history, agriculture, diet, human work (in the fields of war and on farms), waters, forests, bees and flowers.",

How can we describe the meanings that we intuitively associate with these units? Why is it important to have a precise way of studying meaningful aspects of language? It places the study of meaning within a general approach to the scientific study of language by approaching it through the lens of empirical phenomena that students can relate to in their own use of language. Most of the course deals with meaning in spoken languages but students learn how the core principles apply to signed languages in a unit devoted to American Sign Language. By developing an appreciation of the scientific study of meaning, students can explore the role of language, and specifically meaning, in shaping courtroom decisions and in creating marketing and advertising campaigns. At the end of the course students, working in small groups, make a poster presentation showcasing their understanding of some aspect of natural language meaning. This course was previously taught as LING: 167.",

Linguistics is a science that addresses this puzzle for human language. Language is one of the most complex of human behaviors, but it comes to us without effort. Language is common to all societies and is typically acquired without explicit instruction. Human languages vary within highly specific parameters. The conventions of speech communities exhibit variation and change over time within the confines of universal grammar, part of our biological endowment. The properties of universal grammar are discovered through the careful study of the structures of individual languages and comparison across languages. This course introduces analytical methods that are used to understand this fundamental aspect of human knowledge. In this introductory course students learn about the principles that underly all human languages, and what makes language special. We study language sounds, how words are formed, how humans compute meaning, as well as language in society, language change, and linguistic diversity.",

        "description": "This course introduces the design and analysis of computational models of language. There are many properties of language that make it challenging to handle computationally: First, language is ambiguous - a given word or sentence can have many possible meanings. Second, our linguistic experience is sparse - many aspects of language (e.g., certain sentence structures) occur very rarely, posing a challenge for computational systems that learn from data. Third, language has an enormous amount of hidden structure - words and other linguistic units can have complex relationships with each other that are not apparent on the surface. In this course, we explore the computational approaches that can overcome these challenges. Topics include finite state tools, neural networks, Bayesian approaches, computational morphology and phonology, grammar and parsing, lexical semantics, and the use of linguistic models in applied problems.",

No, because you’d still need to know how to put the words together to form all and only the grammatical sentences of that language. This course focuses on the principles of our mental grammar that determine how words are put together to form sentences. Some of these principles are shared by all languages, some differ from language to language. The interplay of the principles that are shared and those that are distinct allows us to understand how languages can be very similar and yet also very different at the same time. This course is mainly an introduction to syntactic theory: it introduces the questions that the field asks, the methodology it employs, some of the main generalizations that have been drawn and results that have been achieved. Secondarily, this course is also an introduction to scientific theorizing: what it means to construct a scientific theory, how to test it, and how to choose among competing theories.",

The course is centered around sensory illusions, which are special cases of sensory processing that can be especially illustrative, as well as delightful. These special cases are used to learn about the general principles that organize sensation across modalities and species.",

        "description": "This course provides students a working knowledge of two fundamental topics related to mechanical design: machine elements and manufacturing processes. Machine elements refer one or more of a range of common design elements that transmit power and enable smooth and efficient motion in mechanical systems with moving parts. This course introduces the most common of these elements and gives students the tools to systems design with them. Topics include common linkages, gearing, bearings, springs, clutches, brakes, and common actuators such as DC motors. Manufacturing processes are necessary for the mechanical design engineer to effectively perform her or his duties; they provide an understanding of how the parts and systems that they design are fabricated, allowing \"Design for Manufacturing\" principles to be taken into account in the product development process. Students learn the basics of common commercial manufacturing processes for mechanical systems, including low-volume processes such as machining to high-volume processes such as casting (metal parts), molding (plastic parts), and stamping (sheet metal parts).",

As we explore such questions about the connection between music and memory, we consider how our relationships to ourselves, communities, and societies can be shaped through remembering music. We explore this through musical case studies, memory studies, and musical technologies of remembering. This exploration involves an interdisciplinary approach, with studies of music at its center.

Emphasizing a collaborative approach, the course focuses on the intersection of performance and composition, offering a space where students engage in the creative process through hands-on interaction with newly composed works. Students will explore the unique challenges and rewards of bringing contemporary compositions to life, learning to interpret and communicate the composer's vision while also contributing their artistic insights to the ongoing evolution of each piece. \n\n\nThroughout the course, students will gain invaluable experience in collaborative and idiomatic problem-solving, creative flexibility and leadership, and interdisciplinary communication; key skills that are essential for success in today's evolving musical landscape. Instrumentalists will deepen their understanding of their roles in bringing to life a new piece, learning not only how to execute a new composition but also how to actively shape the piece's final form through dialogue and experimentation with the composer, culminating in a performance of multiple new works.",

In this class, we: 1) explore the ways in which causation in the social world breaks the mold of those so-called \"classic\" cases of causation; 2) investigate the philosophical foundations of causal inference methodology in the social sciences; and 3) consider various normative dimensions of key causal relations in the social world.",

What are our fundamental financial instruments and how and in what order where they developed? Are there fundamental rules behind the way in which humans conduct business? What roles have states and institutions historically played in facilitating or restricting trade? What sources and approaches are available to study trade in pre-modern times? Can business innovations from the past help us think about business in the present? To explore all these questions, this class draws upon data and case-studies drawn broadly from the ancient world but with focus on evidence from ancient Mesopotamia. With the benefit of a giant canvas of history we paint a detailed picture of how business developed through time. We look at examples where business was strictly regulated by state-controlled institutions as well as examples entrepreneurs would have to rely on informal enforcement mechanisms, such as kin-relationships and reputation in repeated interactions. We dive into the effects of shock on individuals and systems – from production shortages to pandemics. And we ask what happens when systems collapse, or value becomes immeasurable (as people have claimed for the 2008 crash). We study family-controlled business groups as an alternative to integrated and professionally managed corporations. And we observe how entrepreneurs adapted to face the financial challenges of states and dawning globalization. This course immerses students in the history of trade and draws on guests from widely different fields and disciplines to showcase the variety of approaches with which scholars address questions of business history.",

Are these ideas more consistent with later Jewish and Christian notions of death and the afterlife, or are they closer to the views of their ancient Near Eastern neighbors? In this course we examine the development of biblical and ancient Near Eastern concepts of death and life-after-death. We look at a variety of different types of texts that touch upon these themes, such as narrative, poetry, ritual, and law in biblical and other ancient Near Eastern texts. Topics include the depiction of human mortality and divine immortality in literature, dying as a social process, the development of the notion of an afterlife and the concept of the ‘soul’, and communication with the dead, how these texts have been received in the West, and how they have shaped inherited ideas of the immortality of the soul, human suffering, and divine justice. The aim of the course is to develop an awareness of the ancient historical and cultural context in which these texts were authored, and to deepen our understanding of modern views of mortality.",

How come a little exposure can be good for us but too much deadly? Is nuclear energy a viable option? Is my cell phone dangerous? Should I get that dental x-ray? By the end of the course students are armed with necessary physics insights to answer the above questions and more.\n\nEnrollment limited to first-year students.",

This course examines these questions through the lens of the 2010-11 uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. After the initial optimism of the uprisings forced a reexamination of decades of scholarship, trajectories of regime retrenchment, conflict, and violence led to renewed interest in long-running debates on the persistence of non-democratic regimes in the region. First, looking beyond the region, this course considers debates on how to categorize political regimes and engages with theories of autocratic persistence around the globe. Moving back to the region, we trace the trajectories of different countries before and after 2010-2011. We then engage with how scholars situated the uprising within long-running debates on how historical and colonial legacies; cultural, ethnic, and religious practices and divides; contemporary patterns of foreign intervention; repression and coercion; economic resources; and contentious politics influence contemporary political outcomes in the region.",

We analyze the role of law in the legitimation of authority, contestations for political power, and political resistance. We ask, why do some countries end up with strong and independent judiciaries while others don’t? Why did some countries implement radical and comprehensive transitional justice prosecutions, while other countries chose to forget about the atrocities of the past? The class explores whether significant social and political change can be achieved through the courts. Finally, we delve into the challenges of implementing reforms in the legal field.",

We analyze and evaluate the sources and execution of key foreign policy decisions in historic and contemporary case studies from the end of the Second World War to the present. Key topics of interest focus on decisions to use military force, employment of economic tools of statecraft, the role of human rights and values, managing great power competition, and U.S. relations with the Global South. By the end of the course, students should have an in-depth understanding of what has guided major American foreign policy decisions and be equipped to think about what factors will inform future policy decisions.

        "description": "Few societies have been as reliant on experts as our own. As societies grow more complex and technology advances, so does the need for experts who have undergone years of specialized training. Ordinary citizens, firms, state bureaucracies, courts, and legislators constantly rely on experts to guide them in their decisions. However, this reliance is far from seamless. Opportunities to become a successful expert are uneven and often depend on circumstances beyond individual control. Specialists must counter public skepticism and compete with rival groups to establish their authority. Decision-makers are inundated with claims of expertise, making it challenging to discern between valid and dubious advice. Experts can exacerbate issues, fail catastrophically, or neglect public concerns to serve their own interests. Moreover, the increasingly specialized knowledge possessed by experts can seem esoteric and detached from everyday life, leading laypeople to view them with suspicion. For these reasons and others, the very notion of expertise has become highly politicized in recent years. Our society seems to be more and more divided between those who think that experts are indispensable to solve our problems, and those who see them as the root of our troubles. The course adopts an interdisciplinary perspective to explore these issues, drawing from both classical and modern research in sociology, political science, psychology, and philosophy.",

The course examines a variety of perspectives on the environment and cities, featuring Indigenous art and film, essays on the Amazon, and the works of women photographers, filmmakers, and authors. Students explore how we can decolonize our viewpoints by revisiting the past and reimagining the future. Instead of traditional textbooks, students analyze authentic materials, such as newspaper articles, short novels, essays, media, and academic texts that address contemporary political, social, and environmental issues. Through compelling themes, author interviews, and cultural topics, students deepen their language skills while critically examining social issues. Students refine their Portuguese through multimodal texts and projects, with an opportunity to submit their work for publication in the Yale Portuguese Students’ Digital Magazine.",

Through case studies of individuals with various brain injuries and disorders, students learn how specific brain areas contribute to attention, memory, language or/and motor control. By examining the consequences of various pathologies, students learn about the connections between brain structure and function, offering a unique window into the complex processes that govern human behavior. The course covers state-of-the-art neuroimaging and neurophysiology techniques and clinical assessment methods to understand how disruptions to the brain’s architecture lead to cognitive and behavioral changes. We discuss a range of neuropsychiatric conditions, including stroke, epilepsy, dementia, movement disorders, or traumatic brain injury to understand the challenges presented by these disorders. Whether it’s unraveling the mysteries visual agnosia, attention and memory disorders, or studying the profound shifts in personality after frontal lobe injury, this course provides an exciting journey into the brain’s function from the perspective of individual patients.",

We incorporate theories and practices from a wide range of branches of psychology, including social, clinical, industrial/organizational, neuropsychology, developmental, environmental, and media psychology as a framework and foundation for the course. Case studies include but are not limited to Disney, social media corporations, news outlets, food companies, and companies marketing products considered addictive. Interwoven topics include clinical ramifications of marketing and media as well as bias formation from media and film consumption. Students use psychological principles to analyze specific examples from advertisements, social media, news outlets, and film from the perspective of the marketer and the consumer.",

However, in some cases, humans also experience thoughts and urges to intentionally hurt themselves─and in extreme cases─to end their own lives. This course explores past and current cutting-edge models for understanding suicide and other self-destructive behaviors, such as nonsuicidal self-injury, eating disorders, and substance use. We consider the classification, etiology, assessment, prevention, and treatment of such behaviors from psychological, developmental, clinical, social, and neurobiological perspectives.

It joins together religious studies, social scientific, historical, and aesthetic approaches to teach about contexts of practice, genealogies of tarot phenomena, and their visuality. It establishes a foundational knowledge of tarot by exploring popular culture (mis)representations, tracing its longstanding eclectic history, and studying its archetypes.  Conceptually, the course uses tarot as an avenue to discuss conceptual themes of materiality and aesthetics, esotericism, politics, gender, culture, and worlding. Through this guided study of tarot, we explore tarot’s enduring, yet contested appeal and relativize Western epistemologies, including that of the academy itself.",

In exploration of these topics, flood insurance claims maintained by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and available in a data set with over 2.6 million rows and 40 data fields, serve as a north star in our analytic journey. We address issues that can arise when working with real-world data collection, along with related strategies for handling data that may be incomplete or simply messy.

During the first semester, students read primary research papers on the COVID19 pandemic and emerge from this course with an appreciation for how rapidly scientific knowledge can be utilized to combat a deadly disease. Students learn how to (1) read the primary scientific literature, (2) present this material to the class and, (3) write a group grant proposal. During the second semester, students are required to take MCDB 201L concurrently and identify a Yale research mentor to work with over the summer. Students learn how to write an independent grant proposal to prepare them for summer research. Students receive guaranteed funding upon successful completion of the grant proposal. Credit for SCIE 010 is given only upon completion of SCIE 011. One course credit, one SC or WR credit, is awarded after successful completion of the grant proposal and one year's work. \n\nPrerequisite: Score of 5 on AP biology test or equivalent on IB biology exam. Students MUST take MCDB 201L, Molecular Biology Laboratory, in Spring 2025 concurrent with SCIE 011.",

However, what do we actually know about how African media represent genocide and mass atrocities that occur in Africa? How does the news create and reinforce knowledge about mass atrocities?

The US carceral state is sweeping, with nearly 2 million people currently incarcerated on any given day and a targeted policing apparatus that brings people under the penal net. At the same time, countries in Latin America have high rates of incarceration and often even higher rates of police violence than the US. These dynamics are deeply racialized and shape individuals, families, and communities. But that is not the full story. Liberatory movements have resisted and surged against this subjugation for decades. In this course, students will comparatively study the development of the contemporary carceral state and the political struggles waged against it. Students will read across the social sciences, Black studies, history, and law, as well as performance, memoir, and testimony. By examining the carceral state in this way, students will gain a critical lens on longstanding debates related to race and racism, justice and injustice, and reparation and abolition, in both the US and Latin America. While the course is not exhaustive, it is meant to equip students with a working framework on the critical debates in the field.",

Over two semesters, the class covers three sets of  materials: 1) famous or otherwise influential classical works (mostly historical, some literary); 2) important historical texts that have come to light in recent years but are scarcely known in western scholarship; and 3) classical language texts that support the research needs of enrolled students. Classical Tibetan grammar and other conventions are identified and discussed in the course of the readings.",

To study the worlds inside performance requires movement through literature (including poetry and novels), aesthetic criticism (scholarly and journalistic), historical texts, and attendance at live events. As every performance holds a legacy of many others, students learn to sense the dynamic traditions enacted inside them. The skill set developed in this seminar is portable across the humanities for its solid introductions to archival research, the field of Performance Studies, descriptive writing, historical inquiry, and critical analysis. This course puts the skills of the seminar into actual practice as we take in a musical performance, a play, a dance performance, and a museum visit together.",

In doing so, we will collectively ponder urgent questions such as: What is the relationship between anti-war, anti-fascist, anti-imperialist, anti-racist, anti-misogynist, anti-nationalist, and anti-capitalist social movements and anti-naturalism, anti-realism, anti-spectacle, and anti-entertainment theatrical movements? What is the political significance of experimental theater? What happens and doesn’t happen when theater-makers approach their theater-making as political impactful? How has American experimental theater aimed to put pressure on what both \"America\" and \"theater\" mean? Across the semester, we will center the work of the playwright, director, and theorist Bertolt Brecht as a key antecedent and influence on late 20th century and early 21st century American experimental theater while reading a variety of plays written and performed in Brecht’s wake by artists and collectives such as The Wooster Group, Bread and Puppet, Augusto Boal, Amiri Baraka, Adrienne Kennedy, Jack Smith, Ntozake Shange, Theatre of the Ridiculous, Anna Deavere Smith, My Barbarian, Elevator Repair Service, Young Jean Lee, Brooke O’Hara, Madeline George, Taylor Mac, Morgan Bassichis, Larry Owens, and Cole Escola.

The assembled script contains twenty-one individual scenes - one to twelve minutes per scene - as well as interstitial material by Senelick. The writers represented include (partial list) Euripides, Aristophanes, Christopher Marlowe, May West, Wedekind, Sholem Asch, a scene from Kabuki, and a rousing song from Noel Coward. The scenes are organized thematically, such as Cross-Dressing, The Art of Seduction, Tragic Love, Blackmail, Coming Out, Teen-Age Romance, etc. Each unit will include a range of material from different periods of dramatic history, revealing multiple views of same-sex attraction and love, some covert, some  surprisingly open; some raucously funny, some painfully moving. The course is for actors, directors, dramaturgs, producers, designers (of a minimalist DIY bent), and everyone else interested. The final performance(s) will erupt with a lively, low-to-no-budget cabaret of joyous celebration.",

For 2025, the theme \"Remapping Dance\" engages with scholarship and speakers whose work creatively rethinks embodied performance in ways that might blur the boundaries between performance studies and the wider humanities, and who seek to remake the field of dance studies through expansive interdisciplinary and translocative methodologies. This fall, we focus on rescoring dance through migratory performance and dance labor networks to understand how movement is shaped by the connections and frictions of ever-changing communities. Guests include artists and scholars from within and beyond the fields of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies whose work generatively affords new pathways into and out of performance, suggesting possible futures for the field. Throughout, we explore how different ideas of virtuosity, risk, precarity, radicalism, community, and solidarity are shaped by space and place. We reflect on the ways in which performance has been unevenly recorded and disseminated to remap histories of the field. We rethink how local dance and theater economies are governed by world markets and neoliberal funding models and ask how individual bodies can intervene in these global systems.",

If the independent study is a performance or directing project, the adviser visits rehearsals and performances at the mutual convenience of adviser and student. The project must be accompanied by an essay of about fifteen pages, worth about half the final grade. Although the paper's requirements vary with the project and its adviser, it must be more than a rehearsal log. The paper typically engages interpretative and performance issues as revealed in other productions of the work (if they exist). The writing should be concomitant with rehearsal, to enable each to inform the other, and a draft must be presented to, and commented on by, the adviser at least a week before—not after—the final performance. The final version of the paper, incorporating adjustments and reflections, should be turned in to the adviser no later than ten days after the performance closes, and no later than the first day of the final examination period. An essay project entails substantial reading, at least four meetings with the adviser, and a paper or papers totaling at least twenty pages. A playwriting project normally requires twenty new script pages every two weeks of the term and regular meetings with the adviser. A final draft of the entire script is the culmination of the term's work. Application forms are available from the director of undergraduate studies. Juniors may use one term of these courses to prepare for their senior projects.",

We investigate this structure of intimacy through theoretical, historical, ethnographic, literary, and visual materials and think about the various meanings of monogamy historically as well as transnationally. Monogamy is entangled with relations of private property, with colonial civilizational narratives, with scientific theories about human nature. Polygamy in return has historically been understood as religious and/or cultural difference, and as a remnant of pre-modernity. The course weaves together theoretical readings that equip students with the tools to understand some key concepts that we need for our discussion, such as private property; the private family; colonialism and (cultural) imperialism; law and liberalism; and bourgeois morality with readings that more directly address some of the key ways in which monogamy is imagined, understood and framed. We discuss the turn to a recent rise in nonmonogamy in the \"West\" as a radical and \"liberated\" alternative to life-long or serial monogamy, at times featuring a critique of the private family, which constitutes a curious contrast to the nonmonogamy of religious and cultural Others of the West. Understanding the contemporary discourses and industries (books, podcasts, therapists’ youtube channels) around polyamory and nonmonogamy as a 21st century strategic unity, we analyze how liberalism has framed our understanding of sexual liberation and discuss alternative approaches to freedom.",

We investigate this structure of intimacy through theoretical, historical, ethnographic, literary, and visual materials and think about the various meanings of monogamy historically as well as transnationally. Monogamy is entangled with relations of private property, with colonial civilizational narratives, with scientific theories about human nature. Polygamy in return has historically been understood as religious and/or cultural difference, and as a remnant of pre-modernity. The course weaves together theoretical readings that equip students with the tools to understand some key concepts that we need for our discussion, such as private property; the private family; colonialism and (cultural) imperialism; law and liberalism; and bourgeois morality with readings that more directly address some of the key ways in which monogamy is imagined, understood and framed. We discuss the turn to a recent rise in nonmonogamy in the \"West\" as a radical and \"liberated\" alternative to life-long or serial monogamy, at times featuring a critique of the private family, which constitutes a curious contrast to the nonmonogamy of religious and cultural Others of the West. Understanding the contemporary discourses and industries (books, podcasts, therapists’ youtube channels) around polyamory and nonmonogamy as a 21st century strategic unity, we analyze how liberalism has framed our understanding of sexual liberation and discuss alternative approaches to freedom.",

Beginning with a brief consideration of psychoanalytic conceptions of ‘the subject’, ‘subjectivity’ and their relation to social formations, this course examines some of the ways in which subjectivity has been theorized and brought under critical scrutiny by black diasporic, feminist and queer scholars. It draws on work produced in reference to multiple sites, including the UK, the USA and the Caribbean within the fields of psychoanalysis, social science, the humanities and critical art practice. It aims to critique the divide between ‘interior’ psychic life and ‘exterior’ social selves, as well as considering the relation between ‘freedom’ and subjectivity, including the extent to which ‘freedom’ might require rejection of ‘subjectivity’ as a mode of personhood.",

        "description": "This course examines eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writing (in translation, where applicable) by writers from the Anglophone, Francophone, and Hispanophone islands that make up the Caribbean. Haitian independence in 1804 ushered in a vibrant and diverse print culture that included poetry, plays, newspapers, and historical writing. From the pages of La Gazette Royale d’Hayti (1811–1820), to the poems of Jean-Baptiste Romane (1807–1858), to the historical writings of Louis-Félix Boisrond-Tonnerre (1776–1806), to the operas of Juste Chanlatte (1766–1828), there arose a distinct nineteenth-century literary culture in Haiti. Beginning with national literary developments in Haiti, this course expands to consider writing from Barbados, Cuba, Trinidad, Jamaica, Antigua, and Bermuda. These writings, both fictional and non-fictional, help us to think about whether and/or how a coherent early Caribbean literary tradition developed across geographical, linguistic, national, and imperial lines.",

        "description": "What if the greatest threat to life on Earth is not humanity in general, but the specific practice of human being indexed by whiteness? Since the advent of the \"modern world,\" race has been a defining, though often obscured, fault line along which the human enterprise has unfolded. So what would a racial accounting of humanity’s environmental harm entail? Who else are we as a species beyond the norms and aspirations enshrined by whiteness? And who must we become before Nature phases us out? If there is a future for humanity on Earth, it will not come apart from a serious reckoning with these questions. Guided by these questions, this course interrogates how the West has mutually imagined the category of the human as an aspiring independence from and dominion over Nature, on the one hand, and white, on the other. But beyond uncovering the unspoken whiteness of \"the human\" and its environmental harm, this course further takes up the alternative visions of human being and nature expressed within black nature writing. By undertaking a broad survey of this literary tradition, we consider the unique environmental perspectives of those, who, once considered no more than livestock, were the nature over which their masters ruled and consequently could not so easily imagine their humanity apart from it. Perhaps for this very reason, we may ultimately come to locate in black nature writing the resources for imagining a sustainable human life in nature, rather than apart from it.",

        "description": "This graduate seminar traces the emergence of affect, sense, feeling, and mood as critical keywords in American studies. Particular attention is paid to the manner in which queer theorists such as Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Lauren Berlant, Ann Cvetkovich, Heather Love, Jennifer Doyle, Jonathan Flatley, and José Esteban Muñoz developed the concept in what has been called \"the affective turn\" in queer and feminist aesthetics. The philosophical basis of affect theory in the writings of Spinoza, Heidegger, and Deleuze forms the core of the seminar. We also look to an alternate genealogy for affect politics in the writings of Bergson and Deleuze on fabulation. We consider the psychoanalytic take on affect, in particular, the object relations school of Klein and Winnicott, and we read critics who contrast affect theory with trauma theory. Marxist contributions to affect theory include readings from Virno (on humor), Hardt and Negri (on affective labor), and Ranciere (on the distribution of the sensible). The writings of Jasbir Puar and Brian Massumi on the affective politics of contemporary war, empire, and societies of control are also  considered, as are writings by Fred Moten, Saidiya Hartman, and Frank Wilderson on optimism and pessimism as moods/modalities of black studies.",

Scholarly texts are drawn from the fields of critical race and ethnic studies, gender and sexuality studies, anthropology and sociology of medicine, history, and feminist science and technology studies (fSTS). Seminar participants also engage with the arts and media as critical sites for understanding culture work bringing together knowledge in disability and chronic illness spaces. To embrace community-based research and knowledge sharing, the course features regular guest lectures from grassroots disability justice organizers and culture workers. The course is offered in a hybrid format. To consider what disability studies and work on chronic illness can build together, we explore the work of Moya Bailey, Aimi Hamraie, Jina B. Kim, Sami Schalk, Akemi Nishida, Ryan Cartwright, and Arthur Kleinman, among others. Permission of instructor is required. Undergraduates may also enroll with permission of instructor.",

The goal is to investigate possibilities for scholarly examination of a robust human sensorium of sound, taste, touch, scent, and sight—and even \"sixth senses\"—the points where the senses meet material things (and vice versa) in life and practice. Topics include the cultural construction of the senses and sensory hierarchies; investigation of the sensory capacities of things; and specific episodes of sensory contention in and among various religious traditions. In addition, the course invites thinking beyond the \"Western\" five senses to other locations and historical possibilities for identifying the dynamics of sensing human bodies in religious practices, experience, and ideas.",

The fundamental theoretical questions concern the uniqueness, stability, and reconstruction of the coefficients. This is a vast subject, and we are only able to discuss a few of its important aspects. These include: the Radon transform and other ray transforms, the Calderón problem and related problems for elliptic equations, inverse transport problems and optical tomography, and the Gelfand problem and related problems for hyperbolic equations. The necessary tools from partial differential equations, differential geometry, and microlocal analysis are developed as needed.",

It engages feminist contributions on pivotal debates over the universality of women's subordination, the denaturalization of kinship, and the reframing of gender and sexuality as performative, highlighting the intersection of the \"sex/gender system\" with other analytical categories on a global scale. Through the feminist reevaluation of kinship studies, once the bedrock of anthropology, the course takes up how traditional analyses of biological, social, and societal reproduction that treat politics, economy, kinship, and religion as distinct cultural domains naturalize power and inequality. This paradigm shift inspired empirically informed interdisciplinary analyses across the social sciences and humanities—including in women’s studies, Black and Latina studies, queer studies, masculinity studies, affect theory, and science and technology studies. As such, the seminar is also an invitation to participate in both hopeful and skeptical new visions of anthropology—to dream of an \"otherwise\" future for our and other fields.",

This relationship is intricate and multifaceted, including computation for physics, computation with physics, and computation as a lens through which to understand physical processes. This course takes a more or less random walk within this space, surveying ideas and technologies that either apply computation to physics, that understand physical phenomena through the lens of computation, or that use physics to perform computation. Given the extent to which machine learning methods are currently revolutionizing this space of ideas, we focus somewhat more on topics related to modern machine learning, as opposed to other sorts of algorithms and computation. Since it is covered more deeply in other courses, we do not extensively cover error-corrected/fault tolerant quantum information processing, but we do frequently consider quantum physics. The course does not provide a systematic overview of any one topic, but rather a sampling of ideas and concepts relevant to modern research challenges. It is therefore intended for graduate students in early years of their program or research-inclined senior undergraduate students contemplating a research career. As a result, in addition to the scientific topics at hand, key learning goals include the basics of literature review, presentation, collegial criticism (peer review), and synthesizing new research ideas. Evaluation is primarily through two projects, one a lecture reviewing a topic area of interest and one a tutorial notebook providing worked numerical examples/code meant to develop or introduce a concept.",

It allows students the opportunity to build on individual and group work on contemporary issues studied in the first year research seminars by proposing and developing a final design project informed by that research. Projects aim to reach substantial completion by the end of the fall semester for dissemination / implementation in the Spring term. The Independence of each student and project in the studio grants agency to pursue individual interests and brings a wide array of content and approaches into dialogue. At the same time, the semester is not a pure thesis format: the studio is intended to provide structure and common cause. In addition to individual critiques we will have group pinups and occasional shared deliverables. While each project will have specific content and an area of research, the studio pedagogy will be focused on the means of translating ideas into spatial, social, and political form. While projects may originate in each student’s interests, they are expected to address and impact the broader world. Students are expected to meet regularly with their individual advisors, and with both studio critics per the schedule in the syllabus. While the roles of critics and advisors often overlap, the advisor typically has more expertise in the content of the project and the critics will focus somewhat more on methodology: how to develop concepts and content from the research seminars into some form of concrete manifestation through design. In some cases, shared discussions between advisors and critics may be possible, but it is up to the student to synthesize feedback from multiple sources (including colleagues). The development of each project is ultimately up to its author",

This course examines the fundamental scientific principles governing the thermal, luminous, and acoustic environments of buildings, and introduces students to the methods and technologies for creating and controlling the interior environment. Beginning with an overview of the laws of thermodynamics and the principles of heat transfer, the course investigates the application of these principles in the determination of building behavior, and explores the design variables, including climate, for mitigating that behavior. The basic characteristics of HVAC systems are discussed, as are alternative systems such as natural ventilation. The second half of the term draws on the basic laws of physics for optics and sound and examines the application of these laws in creating the visual and auditory environments of a building. Material properties are explored in detail, and students are exposed to the various technologies for producing and controlling light, from daylighting to fiber optics. The overarching premise of the course is that the understanding and application of the physical principles by the architect must respond to and address the larger issues surrounding energy and the environment at multiple scales and in domains beyond a single building. The course is presented in a lecture format. Homework, computational labs, design projects, short quizzes, and a final exam are required.",

The course starts with a detailed formulation of the theoretical foundations, using kinetic theory and statistical physics to describe the dynamics of many-body systems. Special emphasis is given to collisional processes in various astrophysical systems. Next, after deriving the relevant moment equations, we focus on specific topics related to (1) stellar dynamics, (2) hydrodynamics, and (3) plasma physics. Related to stellar dynamics we cover potential theory, orbit theory, Jeans modeling, gravitational encounters, and secular evolution (bars and spiral structure). In the field of (non-radiative) hydrodynamics we study, among others, the Navier-Stokes equation, vorticity, transport coefficients, accretion flow, turbulence, fluid instabilities, and shocks. We end with a cursory overview of plasma physics, including the Vlasov equation and the two-fluid model, Langmuir waves, Alfvén waves, Landau damping, ideal vs. resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and dynamos. Throughout the course, we focus on specific astrophysical applications.",

Notable examples are various nonlinear wave equations, the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations, the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations and the Einstein field equations of general relativity. Techniques for analyzing their global solutions on various manifolds include (higher order) energy estimates and so-called light-cone estimates. An interesting question for the Einstein equations is whether the so-called \"cosmological principle,’’ according to which only the very special manifolds admitting (spatially) homogeneous and isotropic metrics need be considered for cosmology, is firmly established or whether this principle can be relaxed to allow for much more general manifolds and still be consistent with observations. Another issue is how the Thurston geometrization theorem, established by Hamilton and Perlman via Ricci flow, relates to the \"cosmic censorship conjecture\" of Roger Penrose, often regarded as the main open mathematical problem of general relativity.",

Key topics and concepts include medical data types (e.g., imaging, lab values, oximetry); nonlinearity and complexity in physiological resilience and failure; clinically relevant AI/ML methods; data-driven definitions of medical disease; predictive modeling as a distinct field in AI/ML; and clinical decision-making using modern data and computational tools. The course is led by two instructors with complementary backgrounds that include AI/ML, statistics/data science, medical physiology, clinical medicine, and digital health. Guest lecturers from both clinical practice and industry provide additional context. Course work includes scientific literature review, written reports, oral presentations, and a final project.

The course addresses complexities in the design and analysis of observational studies for the purpose of comparing treatments. We focus on the treatment effect averaged over a target population as the parameter of scientific interest, and we discuss conditions when the parameter can be interpreted as causal. Modern statistical tools for inferring causality are developed and demonstrated. In the first half of the course, we formalize the comparison of a point treatment in cross-sectional observational studies; and we develop regression, propensity score subclassification, matching, weighting, and hybrid estimators. In the second half, we turn to the more complex time-varying treatments in longitudinal observational studies and introduce methods to account for time-dependent confounding and censoring bias. We explain why traditional regression adjustment fails and discuss the methods of g-computation, sequential stratification, marginal structural models, and structural nested models. Examples are drawn from various biomedical and health-related studies.",

The course, which prepares students to transition from the classroom to the real-world practice of biostatistics, assumes a strong foundation in statistical analysis and knowledge of epidemiological methods. The course augments that knowledge with topics frequently encountered in practice (e.g., calculating sample size, handling missing data), and it provides opportunities to apply that knowledge to real world study design and analysis. Throughout, we encourage students to bring a \"big picture\" perspective to their work by considering the study’s research question, aims, and hypotheses, which provide the framework for designing the study and planning and conducting appropriate statistical analyses. Moreover, as biostatisticians must be able to clearly communicate their findings to fellow statisticians and non-statisticians, this course provides multiple opportunities for students to present their work orally and in writing. As in statistical practice, there are opportunities for problem-solving and decision-making at the individual and group level. This course is required of all second-year biostatistics M.P.H. students and M.S. students (standard, data science, and implementation science pathways).",

It introduces different approaches to representing, modeling, managing, querying, and integrating clinical/public health data. In terms of database technologies, the course describes two main approaches—SQL database and non-SQL (NoSQL) database—and shows how these technologies can be used to build electronic health records (EHR), data repositories, and data warehouses. In terms of ontologies, it discusses how ontologies are used in connecting and integrating data with machine-readable knowledge. The course reviews the major theories, methods, and tools for the design and development of databases and ontologies. It also includes clinical/public health use cases demonstrating how databases and ontologies are used to support clinical/public health research.",

The course follows the general framework: (1) examine the structural and functional characteristics of given physiological system; (2) explore how both structure and function (within and between physiological systems) work to promote health; (3) explore how necessary features of each system (or integrated systems) are points of vulnerability that can lead to dysfunction and disease. In addition, this course offers the opportunity to examine each physiological system with respect to influences key to public health interest, e.g., age, race/ethnicity, environmental exposures, chronic disease, microbial disease, and lifestyle, including the protection afforded by healthy lifestyle factors.",

Examples of topics are family planning, maternal pregnancy complications, birth outcomes, and long-term consequences of being born preterm. Important risk factors are covered, with a focus on modifiable risk factors (e.g., smoking and nutrition), key demographics (e.g., age and race/ethnicity), and climate change. For methods, we examine how the use of e.g. negative controls, sibling comparisons and instrumental variables can reduce the numerous biases in this field. Current and landmark studies are discussed and critically reviewed. While students are introduced to basic pregnancy biology along with some public health policy, this course is primarily oriented towards epidemiological research: Students develop the ability to critically appraise the literature in perinatal epidemiology, identify research gaps, and design studies to address these gaps.",

It was a longstanding part of ancient pedagogy; teenage boys played out similar scenarios for hundreds of years as part of their training in rhetoric. It also became a mode of leisure for adult men at various points at Roman history—although that sort of declamation always had an air of deviance about it, since elite men were indulging in a sort of fictional roleplay that was beneath the dignity of \"real\" oratory. In this course, we examine Roman declamation through close study of the declamation scenarios and quotations preserved by Seneca the Elder in the early first century CE. We try to answer some fascinating but difficult questions. Why did Romans teach future orators and politicians through roleplay? What pleasure was there in the process? And what exactly did declamation teach? Was it merely skills of rhetoric? Or did it teach ethics too—the ability to imagine oneself as someone else?",

Students write a final paper in which narratology is brought to bear on a passage/work/author/genre of their choice (in either Greek or Latin).",

How did Greeks construct and negotiate their cultural identity at a time when democracy, the autonomous city state, and Greek dominance in the Mediterranean were things of the distant past? Our seminar grapples with these questions from historical and literary perspectives, engaging with a wide range of material from the first four centuries AD: historiography (e.g., Cassius Dio), rhetoric (Dio Chrysostom, Philostratus, Libanius), satire (Lucian), philosophy (Plutarch, Basil of Caesarea), prose fiction (Achilles Tatius), and poetry (Claudian). The course investigates how Greeks under Rome mobilized the Classical past to understand and fashion their relationship to the present; we explore the institutions, contents, methods, and politics of imperial Greek education and the rhetorical performance culture often labelled as \"the Second Sophistic.\"",

        "description": "The critique of capitalism is thriving. But what, exactly, is the problem with capitalism? Is it flawed, unjust, irrational, or harmful? Is it evil or foolish—or does it simply fail to function? In other words, on what grounds can capitalism be criticized? Setting aside the simplistic accusation of individual greed, three distinct strategies of critique can be identified. First, there is the functional critique: capitalism, as a social and economic system, is inherently dysfunctional and prone to crises. The second is the moral critique, which argues that capitalism relies on exploitation and perpetuates injustice. The third is the ethical critique, which claims that life under capitalism is fundamentally alienating or impoverished, preventing individuals from achieving true human flourishing. These three accusations are as old as capitalism itself. They appear not only in \"progressive\" or emancipatory movements but also in nostalgic and conservative responses to the profound social changes capitalism has brought about. They are found in theoretical debates, political manifestos, literature, and film. This course explores these three lines of critique through a philosophical lens as well as through an examination of literature and films that engage with the issue. The central idea—that capitalism is not merely an economic system but a pervasive way of life that as such warrants critique—is made vivid and comprehensible through this exploration. Readings include Max Weber, Karl Marx, Werner Sombart, Georg Simmel, Theodor W. Adorno, Jürgen Habermas, Nancy Fraser, Upton Sinclair, Bertold Brecht, Thomas Piketty, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Quinn Slobodian.",

How did its theorists think the unique nexus of power, economics, histories, and architecture that is, ideally at least, the university? How did they imagine it, given that it is a highly conflictual entity, riding the forefront of some transformations and at the same time codifying and regulating knowledges and social potentials? We read texts from the global archive called \"critical university studies,\" concentrating on articulations of the problems in theoretical texts.

We open with readings from ancient texts from Mesopotamian, Greek, Latin, and Judaic cultures, and end with the U.S. Civil War. And in between we spend considerable time on the ways in which the advent of Christianity and, in turn, the Reformation, Counter-Reformation, and modern worlds influenced the practices and understanding of leave-taking. En route we explore how, for example, Catholicism sought to extend life into the third realm of Purgatory, why the Reformation sought to undo those imaginative excursions, and the extent to which the different faiths of figures such as Michelangelo, Shakespeare, and John Donne produced radically different kinds of finished—and unfinished—works. As we explore the transformative potential of the goodbye in literary and religious works, we also engage with more recent discussions from theologians, theorists, and therapists about grieving, transitions, and letting go. Our objectives are: to strive to understand the important role that leave-takings play in the history of Christianity and artistic expression, especially between 1300–1850; to probe the difference between religious faiths of early modernity with respect to rituals of saying goodbye and the afterlife; to sharpen our skills as readers, spectators, and listeners of works that engage with complex questions regarding the meaning of one's life and one's lifework; and to contextualize our readings within contemporary conversations about dying, grief, and letting go.

        "description": "A digital identity system establishes a connection between a real person and an internet platform such as an online banking site or a social media platform. Current digital identity systems utilize an ad hoc collection of password-based and multi-factor authentication methods. The inconsistency of these methods leads to user confusion, inconvenience, lack of interoperability, poor privacy properties, and degraded security. Data breaches, account takeovers, and privacy violations have become the norm. Efforts to combat these abuses have only been marginally effective. This course presents design principles for an internet-wide digital identity standard to ameliorate most of these problems. It is based on established principles of commerce and law from the non-digital world such as isolation of sensitive data, distributed trust, rules of evidence, and dispute-resolution procedures. A network of trusted agents maintain a distributed blockchain of transactions that provide evidence of authorization of internet transactions and assign responsibility for breaches of trust.",

These territories, where states come and go and borders shift, have been inhabited by a diverse array of peoples speaking and writing in multiple languages. Writers here wrote in Ukrainian, Russian, Yiddish, Polish, German, Crimean Tatar, and other languages. These writers are usually studied as part of separate national literatures, yet in many cases they held multiple identities, wrote in two or more languages, and belonged to more than one cultural sphere. This course views Ukraine as a richly complex region that challenges the \"national literature\" framework and pushes us to examine the ways in which supposedly separate literary traditions overlap and hybridize in intricate and fascinating ways. Students explore Ukraine from the Carpathians to Crimea, via Kyiv and Kharkiv, through the works of its writers, reading the work of poets at the peak of their national canons alongside forgotten and marginalized voices. All readings and class discussions are in English. Undergraduate students must obtain the permission of the instructor prior to enrolling.",

Our reading is guided by a different \"ism\" each week, from 19th-century eroticism and exoticism, through mid-century cosmopolitanism and colonialism, to second-wave feminism and existentialism in the wake of World War II. These distinct moments in the development of Japanese modernism (modanizumu) are shaped by encounters with foreign cultures and by the importing of foreign ideas and vogues. All the same, we question—along with modernist writer Yū Ryūtanji—the \"critique that says modanizumu is nothing more than the latest display of imported cosmetics\" (1930). We seek to develop a correspondingly nuanced picture of the specific and changing ways in which Japan understood and figured its relationship to the rest of the world through the course of a century. Creative and comparative perspectives are especially welcome, and assignments can accommodate a range of media and presentation formats to suit. There are no prerequisites for this course, beyond an enthusiasm for reading literature. All readings are in translation, however there is an opportunity to read short stories in the original language. To facilitate this, our second class each week is structured around break-out groups that allow students to focus on one of the following: (a) comparative works of Western literature, (b) works of Japanese literary theory, and (c) original-language short stories.",

In the last two years, moreover, the Council on East Asian Studies has been able to acquire a variety of fascinating new collections of Tokugawa period documents to augment the library’s existing holdings. As a result, students at Yale now have the opportunity to use unpublished primary sources to study various aspects of Tokugawa period history in a way that is rarely possible outside of Japan. This course is intended to help graduate students and properly qualified undergraduates build the advanced skills, knowledge, and confidence needed to engage these kinds of materials independently and use them to pursue a variety of historical research topics.

Over the past few decades, a rich body of work has emerged to address this challenge across diverse settings. A common guiding principle is to leverage structural assumptions—such as smoothness, sparsity, or low-rankness in the data—alongside models of the noise to enable effective recovery. This course explores both classical and modern approaches to denoising and structural data recovery, blending theoretical foundations with algorithmic and applied perspectives. Particular emphasis is placed on high-dimensional regimes relevant to modern data analysis, where noise can behave in counterintuitive ways, yet also exhibit predictable patterns that can be exploited for denoising. The course introduces tools and results from high-dimensional probability and random matrix theory that underpin many recent advances in this area.",

Students will engage with comparative perspectives that place Western European development in global context, particularly in relation to China, India, and Japan. The course covers key themes including demographic transitions, the evolution of markets and trade, state formation, financial innovations, labor institutions, human capital development, and historical patterns of inequality. Each week introduces a different empirical methodology commonly used in economic history research, showing how these approaches can be applied to historical questions using original data and case studies. Through analysis of these diverse topics and methods, students will develop a comprehensive understanding of how historical processes shaped modern economic growth and contemporary economic structures.",

        "description": "With ever-growing threats to species worldwide, decision-relevant information is needed to empower local communities, businesses, governments, and conservation practitioners to deliver biodiversity outcomes. Rapidly advancing technologies such as visual and acoustic sensors, eDNA, UAV-based survey approaches, community science, GPS-tracking, computer vision, and AI-informed organismal detections and identifications are hailed as central to this goal and as avenue to accelerate our understanding of biodiversity across scales. In this course we survey and critically assess novel technological avenues for local wildlife monitoring and species assessment. We explore their potential to support global biodiversity monitoring at large and to advance ecological concepts. Each week, we evaluate a different technology arena and discuss its scalability and potential impact in applied and basic ecological contexts. We focus specifically on the use of these methods in currently understudied regions, such as the tropics, and assess the emerging opportunities, as well as limitations and risks, around overcoming existing information and knowledge biases and inequities. Finally, we identify the opportunities for integrating different technologies combined with remote sensing to support a more robust monitoring of planetary biodiversity change. The course consists of faculty, guest, and participant presentations addressing specific themes, followed by group discussions. Course participants are expected to read literature around both the application and potential broader scientific relevance of new technologies. The course draws on some of our own engagement in the recent XPrize Rainforest Final and the upcoming CBD COP 16 and includes select guest presentations from these arenas. The course is held in weekly intervals and is based on readings from the literature, in-class presentations and discussions, and engagements with guests. This is a seminar course that requires synchronous attendance.",

Concomitantly, efforts to prevent and respond to climate change can offer beneficial health impacts to vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. This course focuses on policy research methods, offers a policy to practice approach, and is accountable to communities most vulnerable to climate change. As a foundation, the course explores the \"face of climate inequity\" considering structural biases, social inequities, and racism that undermine health and create challenges for those most vulnerable to climate change. It also increases awareness of cultural values and practices that should be considered in the design, implementation, and evaluation of climate equity and health policies and programs. Further, the framework of the course triangulates rule of law, evidence-based methodologies, and meaningful engagement. It introduces the basic principle of \"rule of law\" as a means to navigate government policy making with an understanding of administrative law and relevant environmental laws. It builds on this foundation to explore policy methods buttressed by evidence that is based on academic and lived experience expertise. It addresses mapping tools and data analysis accountable to disadvantaged populations. It incorporates consideration of \"meaningful engagement\" of vulnerable populations, with a special focus on the disproportionate impacts of climate change on the whole health of disadvantaged individuals, families, and communities. Further, key health topics are highlighted through integrative case studies, including climate resiliency and family mental health and health care systems. Innovation at the state and local levels of government are also addressed. Throughout the course, attention is directed to integration of these concepts through applied learning.",

        "description": "This course is designed to introduce immunobiology Ph.D. students to translational research and medicine. Each weekly seminar focuses on a specific disease with a significant immunological component. In-class sessions consist of highly interactive, didactic sections covering patient experiences, disease phenotypes, underlying immunobiology and pathology, and mechanisms of treatment approaches, including their limitations. Considerable student participation is required. Students are required to read and critically review assigned reading related to the weekly seminar topics. They discuss these papers in class, evaluating the methodologies, results, and conclusions, and identifying gaps in knowledge and potential areas for further research. Discussions are led by principal investigators specializing in human translational immunology, with particular input from clinician-scientists who treat patients in associated clinics. Students are presented with real-world case studies that illustrate the complexities and challenges of translational research and clinical practice. Examples of topics include: T and B cell contributions to the underlying pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, other autoimmune diseases, early-life immunity, immune responses to acute brain injury, inherited immune disorders, paradigms governing how anti-tumor immune responses are promoted or suppressed, current approaches in immunotherapy-based clinical trials, and immune responses to infection and vaccination. To promote critical thinking and the identification of new challenges and scientific questions in translational immunology, students are given weekly assignments. These assignments challenge students to think creatively about solutions to problems that hinder progress in understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapeutics. A term assignment, in the form of a research proposal, focuses on an independent study of a translational immunobiology problem chosen by each student. This assignment must differ from their thesis research. The combination of medical knowledge and interaction with translational and clinician-scientists provides a new perspective for IBIO Ph.D. students, broadening their basic science training. Exposure to the practice of medicine enables immunobiology (and other) graduate students to work more confidently at the interface of research and medicine, fostering collaborations with clinical investigators.",

Attention is given to the interplay of race, gender, social inequalities, and marginalized populations when approaching matters of public health ethics. The first part of the course explores core principles of public health ethics; the second part of the course broadly applies these principles to some key areas of the field of public health practice in which ethics are particularly pertinent—infectious disease control, environmental health, social determinants of health, and policies of global health care access. Each session has readings and prerecorded material viewable online that should be completed before class. For each session, we meet for one hour of live discussion and interaction that synthesize and build on the readings and prerecorded material. Brief written reflections are incorporated into live interactions. A paper in which students evaluate ethical principles in relation to practical professional public health experience is developed and discussed incrementally.",

Topics may include props, costumes, cosmetics, boy actors, puppetry, prosthesis, theater architecture, texts, animals, environment, and sensory experience. Readings offer an introduction to the practical craft of early modern theatermaking and critical frameworks for interrogating early modern materiality.",

We open with readings from ancient texts from Mesopotamian, Greek, Latin, and Judaic cultures, and end with the U.S. Civil War. And in between we spend considerable time on the ways in which the advent of Christianity and, in turn, the Reformation, Counter-Reformation, and modern worlds influenced the practices and understanding of leave-taking. En route we explore how, for example, Catholicism sought to extend life into the third realm of Purgatory, why the Reformation sought to undo those imaginative excursions, and the extent to which the different faiths of figures such as Michelangelo, Shakespeare, and John Donne produced radically different kinds of finished—and unfinished—works. As we explore the transformative potential of the goodbye in literary and religious works, we also engage with more recent discussions from theologians, theorists, and therapists about grieving, transitions, and letting go. Our objectives are: to strive to understand the important role that leave-takings play in the history of Christianity and artistic expression, especially between 1300–1850; to probe the difference between religious faiths of early modernity with respect to rituals of saying goodbye and the afterlife; to sharpen our skills as readers, spectators, and listeners of works that engage with complex questions regarding the meaning of one's life and one's lifework; and to contextualize our readings within contemporary conversations about dying, grief, and letting go.",

We study the negotiations between the classical and mass cultural genre systems, the format-specific affordances of the paperback original, the speciation of genre fictions and consolidation of minority and ethnic literatures as publishing categories, the provincialization of literary fiction as one among many fiction genres, and the reincorporation of genre elements into literary fiction since then.

Only in the last decade has some consensus emerged on bilaterian phylogeny. Meanwhile, further insights into various bilaterian clades have been made possible using anatomical, developmental, and genetic data. However, these new sources of information have not been mustered in an attempt to revisit the question of the ancestral bilaterian’s characteristics. In this seminar, we read selected papers on the biology of the major bilaterian clades, including recent evolutionary developmental and paleontological work, and attempt collaboratively to build a character dataset that permits us to reconstruct the features of the ancestral bilaterian.",

Most recently, two developments have pushed this issue to the forefront of scholarly attention: the advent of ecocriticism, which found one of its earliest and most influential champions in Serenella Iovino, and the establishment of regional film commissions, grassroots production centers that sponsored cinematic works attuned to the specificity of \"the local.\" The course includes study of films that predate our current environmental consciousness, as well as recent films that foreground it in narrative terms. In the case of the older films, which have already attracted a great deal of critical commentary over time, we work to shift our interpretive frame in an \"eco-friendly\" direction (even when the films’ characters are hardly friends of the environment). Among the films considered are Le quattro volte, Il vento fa il suo giro, L’uomo che verrà, Gomorra, L’albero degli zoccoli, Riso amaro, Red Desert, Christ Stopped at Eboli, and Il ladro di bambini. We screen one film a week and devote our seminars to close analysis of the works in question.",

For the policy memo, students choose a policy topic of their own, then carry out every step of the policy analysis process, from defining, framing, and analyzing the problem to identifying and evaluating possible solutions, to building a case for recommendations. For the policy-focused essay, students identify practical rhetorical strategies to argue persuasively about their chosen policy topic in the public domain. Students practice deploying both emotional and rational appeals while confronting difficult normative questions about how to write persuasively without manipulating readers or devolving into spin. Finally, for the speech, students study a variety of noteworthy speeches that have had a real-world impact.  Drawing on these insights, students craft their own speech. At the end of the semester, students have the option to present their speeches orally to the Jackson community. Students have the choice to take the course for a grade or Sat/Unsat. Priority is given to Jackson graduate students. In general, students are admitted based on the order in which they apply. Note: this course combines elements of two previous courses offered by the Jackson Writing Program: GLBL 5000, Professional Public Policy Writing, and GLBL 5001, Disinformation and the Craft of Ethical Persuasion.",

        "description": "In the second decade of the twenty-first century, \"big data\" analytics and techniques have fundamentally transformed policy decisions both in the United States and throughout the globe. NGOs, NPOs, political campaigns, think tanks, and government agencies more and more recruit policy analysts with the necessary skills to embrace novel, data-driven approaches to policy creation and evaluation. This course is designed to help students meet this growing demand. It is an introductory course in Python programming and data analysis for policy students with no prior coding experience. Unlike massive introductory classes, this course is deliberately small, designed to provide the necessary support for humanists to make a smooth and nurturing transition to \"tech humanists.\" Ultimately, students should be comfortable using what they’ve learned in further Yale courses in programming and statistics, or in research and policy after leaving Yale. They should know enough to productively collaborate on projects with engineers, understand the potential of such work, have sufficient background to expand their skills with more advanced classes, and perform rudimentary data analyses and make policy recommendations based on these analyses.",

From these building blocks, students consider certain applications of AI to national defense, climate change, and government policies with an eye to the tension between technological capability and ethical imperatives. The goal of this course is for students to emerge first and foremost, with a more advanced tech literacy, if not fluency and to possess a strong AI- and machine-learning working vocabulary. Further, students learn how to effectively differentiate AI from ML, myth from reality, and rational fear from speculative science fiction.",

After the 2008-9 global financial crisis, however, weaknesses in the US model combined with China’s own sustained growth increased Beijing’s confidence in an alternative, state-oriented model that increasingly underpins China's foreign economic engagement. This course examines the basis of China’s economic strength as a precursor to investigating the Belt and Road initiatives, trade, investment, and development policies, international organization advocacy, business practices, and other aspects of China’s growing international economic footprint. These factors are analyzed from the perspective of China’s internal dynamics, competition with the United States, and overall foreign policy goals and are evaluated for their impact on the prevailing global economic order. Planned guest speakers include senior representatives from the State Department and the Embassy of China in Washington, as well as experts on Chinese investment in the United States and Taiwan’s role in global technology supply chains. In-class simulations focus on China’s WTO accession and the Belt and Road Initiative versus the Indo-Pacific Strategy. The course is taught by a practitioner who spent over a decade managing US government economic policy in and on China.",

Machines capable of sophisticated information processing, towards the frontier of autonomy, pose tremendous opportunities for economic growth and societal well-being. Yet the potential risks also are extraordinary.  How can we build AI systems that are reliable, transparent, safe, scalable, and aligned with human values? Following an introduction to AI and survey of current research challenges, the seminar focuses on seven core areas where AI and emergent technologies already pose significant security concerns: (1) lethal autonomous weapons and the nature of conflict, (2) disinformation and the future of democracy, (3) competition and conflict in U.S.-China relations, (4) AI ethics and safety, (5) AI governance, (6) nanotechnology and quantum computing, and (7) outer-space development. For each of these sub-units, the goal is to equip aspiring leaders with requisite technical fluency, and to bridge the divide across the law, technology, and policy communities at Yale.",

Given the integrated nature of trade networks and global financial markets, industrial, monetary and financial policy choices in large economies such as the US, the EU, and China have security implications abroad. These policy choices can play a destabilizing role, fueling global imbalances and/or triggering crises in emerging economies. They also offer unique levers of power: large economies can use their extraterritorial economic influence, either benevolently or coercively, to pursue foreign policy or security goals. Understanding international economics is therefore relevant for a development, foreign policy, or security practitioner. The course builds up the necessary theory and background knowledge to understand the current state of play and focus on possible near-term evolutions. This course has no prerequisites, does not expect students to have an economics background, uses minimal math, and is geared towards M.P.P. and M.A.S. students. Not offered in 2026.",

Since its creation by statute in 1947, the National Security Council (NSC) has served as the primary forum in which the United States has engaged in national-security policymaking. The processes employed have varied across presidential administrations and different agencies. While they have been the subject of some historical inquiry, they remain in flux, and are largely opaque to the general public, even while they form an essential element for understanding some of the government’s most consequential decisions and actions.",

It then takes students through some of the Treaty Bodies and Special Procedures of the United Nations to see the actual working of the UN system with regard to human rights. Finally, it focuses on country specific situations such as apartheid in South Africa, Rwanda, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Israel Palestine to identify the response of the United Nations to widespread human rights violations.

This course delves into the concept of language crises and its long history from a philosophical and literary perspective, examining how crises of language are represented in literature and how they reflect broader philosophical questions about language, identity, and power. We explore different philosophical approaches to language, such as the history of language and philology (Herder, Humboldt, Nietzsche), structuralism and post-structuralism (Saussure), analytical and pragmatic philosophies (Wittgenstein), phenomenology and deconstruction (Heidegger), and analyze how these theories shape our understanding of language while simultaneously evoking its crisis. The course also examines how such language crises are represented and produced in literature and the arts, how authors and artists approach the complexities of language loss, and how crises help birth alternative systems of signification. Through close readings of literary texts by Hofmannsthal, Musil, Bachmann, et. al., we analyze the symbolic and metaphorical significance of language crises as well as the ethical and political implications of language loss for (cultural) identity. Experimental use of language such as DaDa artwork, performance cultures, and \"Sprachspiel\" poetry by the \"Wiener Gruppe,\" as well as contemporary KI/AI literature, further complement the theoretical readings. By exploring language crises through the lens of philosophy and literature, we gain a deeper understanding of the role of language—and its many crises—in shaping our understanding of ourselves and our communities.",

The eminent Protestant professor of theology, Paul Althaus, declared in 1933, \"our Protestant churches have greeted the turning point of 1933 as a gift and miracle of God.\" The roots of Protestant responses to the Third Reich lay in the Imperial Christianity leading to WWI and the chaos of Weimar Germany. Recent scholarship has overturned older narratives of brave resistance and demonstrated that well-known figures such as Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer were anomalies in a Protestant culture of passivity and silence. German Protestant churches remained quiet as Jews were deported. Working with primary sources, students explore the mentalities of collaboration in churches (German Christians) and universities as well as the character of the Confessing Church. The course concludes with the legacy of collaboration and nonresistance.",

Inspired in part by present-day problems of climate change, air pollution, airborne viruses, and police brutality, humanities scholars are teasing out the historical specificity of experiences of the atmosphere. A focus on the atmosphere allows historians to make connections between local, embodied practices and planetary processes. We explore ways to periodize the atmosphere’s history, from its invention in the seventeenth century to its weaponization in the twentieth. While some scholars in the humanities are working in partnership with the natural sciences, others present their work as complements to or critiques of science. We consider how scientific and cultural analyses of the atmosphere can build on each other as well as the tensions between them. Authors include Leo Spitzer, Peter Sloterdijk, Shigehisa Kuriyama, Christina Sharpe, Timothy Choi, and Kimberly Bain.

It is designed specifically for students with no legal training. The course first provides background on the powers and duties of federal, state, and local governments to equitably promote and protect community health, as well as structural constraints on those powers, such as protection of individuals’ constitutional rights. Then, using case examples, it focuses on law as a tool to promote population health, including through direct and indirect regulation to alter the information and built environments, through measures to control communicable disease and reduce chronic disease and injury, and through the use of governments’ \"power of the purse\" to fund public health programs and services and influence individual and corporate behavior. Throughout the term, the course examines the role of courts in interpreting law and resolving disputes among branches and levels of government as well as among individuals, businesses, and government. Students gain basic proficiency in finding and interpreting primary legal sources, applying the law to public health problems, and identifying ways to most effectively influence the legislative, administrative, and judicial lawmaking processes. The course requires active student engagement that often includes working in small groups.",

Much of this work has focused upon the work of royal academies’ explorations of natural philosophy and the mechanical arts. This seminar seeks to move beyond that narrow geographic focus and descriptive taxonomies to consider embodied artisanal knowledge throughout the world in the period from 1500 to 1800. As Tim Ingold reminds us, embodied knowledge is a skilled, socially generated practice distinct from the innate talents of mechanical execution. It is a cognitive skill that prizes resourcefulness; efficiency of effort; and informed, intensive use of tools. This tacit knowledge, the intellect of the hand, is experienced and felt rather than written about and illustrated. Making things depends upon constant attention to the transmission of ideas from brain to hand and from tool to material, with feedback channeled back through the tool to the body and mind of the maker. This seminar combines reading, object-driven inquiry, and hands-on exercises to explore the role of materials, techniques, and human agency in the making of objects. Students expand their own approaches to the study of artisans and objects from many periods and places.",

This seminar draws on a range of media theoretical approaches to examine the complex and historically layered repertoire of visual techniques within which architecture operates. We approach architecture not as an autonomous entity reproduced by media, but as a cultural practice advanced and debated through media and mediations of various kinds (visual, social, material, and financial). If questions of media have played a key role in architectural theory and history over the past three decades, recent scholarship in the field of media theory has insisted on the architectural, infrastructural, and environmental dimensions of media. The seminar is organized around nine operations whose technical and historical status will be examined through concrete examples. To do so, the seminar presents a range of differing approaches to media and reflects on their implications for architectural and spatial practices today. Key authors include Giuliana Bruno, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Beatriz Colomina, Robin Evans, Friedrich Kittler, Bruno Latour, Reinhold Martin, Shannon Mattern, Marshall McLuhan, Felicity Scott, and Bernhard Siegert, among others.",

As part of the exercise of writing an Educational Philosophy, students will take a Teaching Perspectives Inventory which will provide them with a personal profile of their teaching beliefs, intentions and actions. This module also exposes learners to medical education literature on teaching theory and practice for discussion and implementation. There are experiential components outside the classroom in which the student teaches a class in their area of clinical expertise, a trained faculty observer attends the class completing a validated Observation Form. The student and faculty observer meet afterward to review the form, debrief the teaching and the student receives actionable feedback to their teaching. In addition, students attend Graduate Medical Education (GME) Committee meetings led by the Senior Associate Dean for GME. In these meetings GME Program and Associate Program Directors review the performance of resident and fellow education programs and discuss proposals for innovations and new programs to enhance the trainee educational experience. After attending two GMEC meetings and a class by the Associate Dean for GME, the students write a reflection paper on a topic of their choice on GME education. This module provides active classroom learning combined with practical experiences in education for every level of learners who students will encounter in their career. This module has been designed to provide a safe environment where learners are free to seek direction, ask questions and explore possibilities with the support and encouragement of their faculty educators.

The syllabus builds from primers in the medical education literature with required readings and classroom discussion of theory and concepts unique to the field. Faculty educators are experts in their field of instruction and classes are deliberately planned to involve active learning, practice and student presentation in a safe learner-centered environment. Students begin with little or no preexisting knowledge or skills in medical education research, scholarship or teaching and at the end of the two-year course and degree program they have completed an original research project, written a thesis and disseminated it to the YSM community and beyond in the form of presentations, publications and posters. There are many subjects covered in this course and we list a few to highlight the complexity and diversity of the syllabus: Searching and Evaluating the Medical Education Literature, Formulating a Research Question and Designing a Study, Curriculum Planning and Assessment, Student Assessment, Basic Statistics for Educational Research, Teaching and Practical Applications, Assessment Reliability and Generalizability Theory and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups. The course schedule is planned so that each class builds on previous learning and timed to train in the skills required to complete students’ research projects. Faculty educators are available for consults and extra help when needed along with the mentorship of the students’ chosen mentor committee. Students are provided with mentoring and support to pursue their interests in advanced education preparing them for positions in educational leadership and scholarship.

The course is required in both year 1 and year 2 of the MHS-CI curriculum, with sessions held in the fall and spring semesters for a total of four semesters. Each semester, the course meets once a week for 1 hour in the afternoon, totaling 15 sessions per semester. Structured as a combination of lectures and discussions, the course covers a wide range of topics, including clinical investigation methodologies, hypothesis-driven research project formulation, ethical considerations, and regulatory compliance. Preparation outside of class time will be required and consist of 1 hour per session readings from current review articles, chapters from online textbooks, and original research articles provided by the faculty. Speakers from both internally and externally, including experts from Yale and industry leaders, will give talks throughout the course. Additionally, students have the unique opportunity to participate in guided visits to institutions such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and pharmaceutical companies, gaining exposure to real-world applications of clinical investigation. A key component of the course is the requirement for MHS-CI students to present their own research findings every six months. This provides students with an opportunity to showcase their scholarly achievements and receive feedback from peers and faculty members. Furthermore, the seminar series will feature presentations by both internal and external faculty members, facilitating the dissemination of ongoing research endeavors and fostering collaborative opportunities. Upon completion of the MHS-CI Seminar Series, students will gain skills as forward-thinking clinical investigators, equipped to tackle the multifaceted challenges present in modern healthcare settings.

Lectures in neurophysiology cover various aspects of neural function at the cellular and systems levels, with a strong emphasis on the mammalian nervous system. Clinical correlations consist of sessions applying basic science principles to understanding pathophysiology in the context of patients. Seven three-hour laboratory sessions are coordinated with lectures throughout the course to provide an understanding of the structural basis of function and disease. Case-based conference sections provide an opportunity to integrate and apply the information learned about the structure and function of the nervous system in the rest of the course to solving a focused clinical problem in a journal club format.

The modern bourgeois aesthetic form par excellence may be routinely described by literary theorists as emerging and seeing its major developments in Spain, Britain, France, or Russia. Italy is usually excluded from this particular invented cultural trajectory. Instead of seeing this assessment as an indictment on Italian versions of the novel form, we interpret the supposed lack as an opportunity for rethinking the novel from a marginal vantage point. We read six canonical Italian novels and six minor ones that may be read as critical responses to the better-known texts, beginning at the start of the nineteenth century and ending two centuries after with the likely winner of the 2025 Premio Strega. Throughout the class, we ask what may be peculiar or eccentric about the Italian novelistic tradition by focusing, in particular, on the ways in which the novel registers and encodes philosophical debate about the nature of time and history; collective and individual memory; class and social mobility; Bildung and selfhood. The class is held in English, but reading knowledge of Italian is required (we read all texts in Italian; many of them do not have available English translations).",

Weekly meetings are run and coordinated by a faculty member in Italian, generally the graduate adviser. Each week of the first nine weeks is devoted to a specific topic on the comprehensive lists requested by the students themselves. Students are in conversation with each other, with the presiding faculty member, and with an additional guest lecturer who is an expert in the areas under discussion. Following the ninth week, there is a dry run of the oral exam. The remaining four weeks are devoted to discussing the composition of the topics lists and to the writing of the prospectus. Informal meetings may continue through the spring to discuss these issues as well.",

Abelard was a celebrity professor at the dawn of the university, only to spectacularly fall into disgrace for a secret love affair with Heloise that resulted in his castration at the hands of his father-in-law. As we read Abelard’s fascinating account of his life, we focus on reinforcing our knowledge of Latin grammar and syntax and pay special attention to the features of Abelard’s language that are typical of Medieval Latin.",

Beginning with ancient Jewish and Greco-Roman perspectives, it explores how different communities in the Mediterranean conceptualized and enacted nuptial kinship through a ritual process from betrothal through consummation and probes the anthropological and religious underpinnings of these practices. It then considers early Christian debates on the roles of marriage, sex, and family, and analyzes the early evidence for the Christianization of marriage ritual. Through original texts (available in translation), as well as visual and material sources, the course traces the development of these rites across medieval Christian traditions of the West (Italy, Gaul, Spain, etc.) and East (Byzantine, Coptic, Syriac, Slavic, etc.), and explores the diversity of theological visions and socio-cultural values they express. While focused on pre-modern Christianity, this course encourages frequent comparison to Jewish and Islamic traditions (including legal and ritual frameworks, as well as the calendrical regulation of sexual relations), invites comparison to other kinship rituals (such as medieval rites of \"brother-making\" or filial adoption), and also provides opportunities for students to engage with ritual developments of the Reformation and explore the legacy of historic marriage practices within contemporary religious, legal, and cultural traditions and debates.",

The goal of this seminar is to academically participate in the process of critically reflecting about the nature of the Eucharist through an examination of the shape, form and texts employed across Christian history, from antiquity to today. We examine studies and original texts (in translation) to provide perspective on the origins and historical development of the eucharistic liturgy, survey the structure and content of different medieval rites both eastern and western, examine artistic, musical and architectural developments, and undertake a systematic reflection on various theological issues across Christian history (e.g. commensality, real presence, transubstantiation, the role of ministers, excommunication, the dynamics of liturgical reform, and other concerns). Illumined by historical and theological reflection, students also engage in critically examining contemporary pastoral concerns as instantiated in different denominations.",

Organized around six rubrics—Collecting, Describing, Displaying, Embodying, Disembodying, and Representing—we aim to cut across long-standing divides between collections, archives and libraries, on the hand, and scholarly/artistic spaces of the academic world; between preservation and consumption; between privacy and publicity; between the social sciences and the humanities. Through critical readings that engage with diverse geographic and temporal subjects; the close analysis and physical handling of rare books, maps, manuscripts, images, objects, and textiles; and an orientation to cultural heritage and library professional practices and procedures, students learn the critical interventions of the history of the book and the archival turn in the humanities; the key concepts and genealogies of archives and library special collections; and the generative collaborations currently underway between faculty and librarians to jointly address legacies of racism and white privilege, advance intellectual freedom and parity, and define the ethical stewardship of the material histories of the human record today. This workshop takes the form of a half-credit course in each semester that meets six times a term (every other week). This course must be taken before or after MHHR 7001 to earn 1 full credit. We welcome all curious students to the first class, but permission of the instructors is subsequently required for enrollment/registration. This course meets in the Gates Classroom, Sterling Library.",

        "description": "What does a musical amateur sound like? With etymological roots in the Latin amare, amateurism initially referred favorably to someone pursuing an activity for love rather than financial gain. Today, musical amateurs are often understood as those who perform outside of professional settings, receiving little or no compensation for their labor. In other contexts, \"amateur\" has become a pejorative term for those without substantial skill or talent—as George Bernard Shaw famously put it, \"hell is full of musical amateurs.\" These definitions, however, barely scratch the surface of amateurism’s complex meanings across musical practices and communities. In this course, we interrogate the shifting role and reputation of the musical amateur, exploring the fluid boundaries between amateur and professional. We also question the relevance of this distinction entirely, considering other ways to understand humans’ motivations for making music—and the standards by which that music is evaluated. Engaging with scholarship across and beyond the music disciplines, we consider how amateurs have provoked conversations around music’s relationship with capitalism, with expertise, with formal education, with pleasure, and with failure.",

Through exploring this intersection, this seminar brings crucial aspects of both media into relief. In dialogue with work in the fields of musicology, ethnomusicology, music theory, media studies, visual culture, and philosophy, we analyze remediations of Black music and musicalities on platforms like X, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, WhatsApp, and Facebook, among others. The seminar engages with the theory of \"digital antiphony\" as a framework for understanding the modes of creativity that many digital artifacts reveal and the ways of listening that these potentially-viral objects solicit, showing how various notions of musicality shape the experience of Blackness and sociality in the digital episteme.",

In this course we examine the development of biblical and ancient Near Eastern concepts of death and life-after-death. We look at a variety of different types of texts that touch upon these themes, such as narrative, poetry, ritual, and law in biblical and other ancient Near Eastern texts. Topics include the depiction of human mortality and divine immortality in literature; dying as a social process; the development of the notion of an afterlife and the concept of the \"soul\"; communication with the dead; how these texts have been received in the West; and how they have shaped inherited ideas of the immortality of the soul, human suffering, and divine justice. The aim of the course is to develop an awareness of the ancient historical and cultural context in which these texts were authored, and to deepen our understanding of modern views of mortality.",

It is also the site of the enigmatic sun-temples that had religious and economic functions. Remains of settlements have been detected in relation to the mortuary and valley temples associated with the pyramids at the site. However, the occupation and building activities at Abusir did not stop in the Old Kingdom but saw the construction of a Ramesside temple and the emergence of an important cemetery dating to the Saite-Persian Period (sixth century BCE) later on. The recent fieldwork by several Czech missions has resulted in some groundbreaking new publications, which are studied and discussed in depth during this seminar.",

Students explore the origins of the valley, its development over time, and the eventual decline of this royal burial ground. As a class, we explore the boundaries and rules of death space: who has access and when? How did the natural topography affect the development of the necropolis over time? What influences do religious beliefs and political, social, and economic events have on the evolution of this sacred space over time?

The first official gazette of the Ottoman Empire, the Takvim-i Vekayi, was published in 1831, followed ten years later by the second major newspaper, the Ceride-i Havadis (1840). Following these two earliest Turkish newspapers, the Ottoman press began to evolve independently of the state newspapers, with publications beginning to openly criticize government policies. This course focuses on chronological readings of articles and essays published in Ottoman newspapers to help students understand the nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ottoman society from direct accounts and perspectives. We read excerpts from popular newspapers of the period, starting with the Takvim-i Vekayi and other gazettes published in Ottoman script until the alphabet revolution in 1928. Students examine the evolutions of themes of women’s roles, fashion, minorities, social and cultural events, intellectual, literary, and political movements in the Ottoman (and early Republican) society. These readings also highlight the evolution of the Ottoman language through the contributions of influential writers of the period. The course emphasizes building a richer vocabulary, developing proficiency in Ottoman Turkish reading skills, and deepening an understanding of Turkish grammar and syntax. Students engage with key principles of textual criticism to achieve a deeper understanding of Ottoman society, linguistics, and cultural transformations as reflected in its press.",

Can trust or hope be voluntary? Should we hold religious beliefs to the same epistemic standards that apply to more mundane beliefs? Or should we persist in faith even if these beliefs do not meet conventional rational standards?

The course begins by exploring how the emergence of the idea of the sovereign state in seventeenth-century Europe inaugurated a new way of thinking about the problems of political authority and legitimacy. This vision would mature over the eighteenth century, while also triggering numerous skeptical rejoinders that arguably culminated in pluralist critiques in the early twentieth century. While this story forms one strand of the seminar, its main focus is on the transformation of the modern state in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We examine how the rise of the social imbued the idea of the state with new purposes and how an expanded conception of administrative power facilitated a powerful reconceptualization of the state-society relationship. We explore these problems against the backdrop of the rise of democracy in the nineteenth century. The course also considers the globalization of the state-form in the wake of decolonization and postwar international order—asking how the modern state became the global standard, and with what tensions and contradictions. We analyze the intellectual formation of the developmental state, focusing especially on the expanded vision of executive power that propelled postcolonial founding projects across Asia and Africa. Readings include canonical texts in political thought (Hobbes, Tocqueville, Weber, Laski, Nehru), as well as more recent studies in the intellectual history of the modern state. The seminar approaches the problem of the modern state from a global perspective, engaging historiographies from both European and non-European contexts.",

We examine questions such as how does domestic politics affect the foreign policy choices of leaders and states? Who are the key domestic actors and what do the actors want? How do domestic actors form their preferences? Do domestic political institutions matter, and if so, how? Topics include rallying and diversionary conflict, war and the fate of leaders, domestic interest groups and sectoral politics, elite messaging and propaganda, democratic peace, and the rise of populism and nationalism. Students also have a chance to develop their own research skills by writing and presenting a research paper outline. Assignments also include writing practice referee reports and response papers. This class is aimed at political science Ph.D. students interested in international relations.",

        "description": "The Identity and Conflict Lab (ICL), led by Professor Nicholas Sambanis, is launching a new graduate-level course focusing on the politics of intergroup conflict broadly conceived. The lab’s research is motivated by major problems of our time, such as civil war, ethnic violence, racial prejudice, and religious intolerance. The lab sponsors research on all these areas, with a particular focus on identity politics: how social identities shape individual behavior, how conflict affects identities, and what interventions are effective in reducing conflict. The ICL course reviews the state of the debate on key topics in which the ICL has active research and identifies new research questions that lab affiliates can address by collecting new data and applying cutting edge analysis in a collaborative setting. The lab involves affiliated faculty at Yale and other universities, post-doctoral fellows, and students. The lab promotes an interdisciplinary, multimethod approach to the study of conflict. Students affiliated with the lab must attend workshops and meetings biweekly and are expected to complete reading assignments, comment on lab affiliates’ work in progress, and present their own work to the lab on suitable topics decided in consultation with the lab director. Students taking this course have opportunities to join ongoing lab projects depending on their interests and skills.

There is a slightly higher emphasis on probability theory than in many applied statistics courses, with the goal of making concepts such as confidence intervals and p-values easier to understand. However, care is taken to make this material accessible by providing numerous psychology-relevant examples and avoiding unnecessary mathematical details. To promote deeper understanding, commonly used statistical models and tests (t-tests, ANOVA, simple linear regression, multiple regression, ANCOVA) are explained as special cases of linear regression rather than separate procedures. Other topics include mixed effects models and generalized linear models (e.g. logistic regression) besides other material depending on time and student interest. Alongside statistical theory, students learn to use R, a computer programming language specialized for data analysis.",

The goal is threefold: to foster a critical appreciation of existing research on individual judgment, to develop the students’ skills in identifying and testing interesting research ideas, and to explore research opportunities for adding to existing knowledge. Students generally enroll from a variety of disciplines, including cognitive and social psychology, behavioral economics, finance, marketing, political science, medicine, and public health.",

The MCE is intended to integrate basic and translational research with direct exposure to clinical medicine and patients afflicted with the diseases or conditions under discussion. The course provides a foundation and a critically important forum for class discussion because each module stimulates students to explore a disease process in depth over four ninety-minute sessions led by expert clinician-scientists. The structure incorporates four perspectives to introduce the students to a particular disease or condition and then encourages them to probe areas that are not understood or fully resolved so they can appreciate the value and challenge inherent in using basic science to enhance clinical medicine. Students are provided biomedical resource material for background to the sessions as well as articles or other publicly available information that offers insight to the perspective from the non-scientific world. During this course students meet with patients who have experienced the disease and/or visit and explore facilities associated with diagnosis and treatment of the disease process. Students are expected to prepare for sessions, to participate actively, and to be scrupulously respectful of patients and patient facilities. Prior to one of the sessions students receive guidance as to what they will observe and how to approach the experience; and at the end of the session, the students discuss their thoughts and impressions. All students receive HIPAA training and appropriate training in infection control and decorum relating to patient contact prior to the course.",

(With additional approval of the Office of Public Health Practice, this course can also be used to meet the Applied Practice Experience requirement for graduation.) This practicum experience addresses the objectives of the concentration and is conducted in partnership with a public health or other community organization. Students who choose to complete the practicum during an academic term enroll in this course (in lieu of EPH 500). Prior to the practicum, students complete a work plan and project description that will be reviewed by a faculty adviser and their preceptor at the partner organization. Possible projects may include evaluation, needs assessment, advocacy, public health communication, and/or service provision. Projects should be focused on understanding and ameliorating social or structural determinants of health inequality. During the practicum, students participate in biweekly group reflection meetings with concentration faculty and other concentration students. Upon completion of the practicum, students produce a minimum of two tangible work products or deliverables. These projects and deliverables must be distinct from the students’ thesis work or work completed in other independent study courses.",

Topics of traditional interest in both fields—suffering, illness, healing, and well-being—are addressed in interdisciplinary terms. The focus is not on chaplaincy ministry nor on biomedical ethics, but on a conversation reflecting on the application of healing science and religious wisdom to human need. Key to this conversation is recognition that doctors and theologians share a need for the healing and spiritual health they hope to nurture in others.

        "description": "This seminar is an examination of the life and select writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, \"the one German theologian who,\" German liberation theologian Dorothee Sölle affirmed, \"will lead us into the third millennium.\" A pastor, theologian, staunch anti-Nazi insurgent, and founding member of the Confessing Church, Bonhoeffer’s life, thought, and death by execution at the Flossenbürg gallows distinguish him as one of the most influential theologians of the twentieth century. In this course, students explore the evolution of Bonhoeffer’s theological project and the fundamental themes—Christ, community, discipleship, the church, difference, and justice for the oppressed—of his major work, in conversation with twenty-first-century moral issues like anti-Black racism, sexism, poverty, homo/transphobia, and xenophobia. An investigation of the varied genres of Bonhoeffer’s theological and ethical legacies which emerge from a life that spanned two world wars; crises of class, modernity, and difference; and the death-dealing scourge of the Nazi regime, propel consideration of the cost and the trajectory of responsible Christian faith and moral action for the contemporary church and in a world come of age.",

We consider questions of the sources, methods, and interlocutors of Christian ethics. We also consider particular ethical topics garnering attention in the field, including political theology, animal ethics, racial justice and racial capitalism, aesthetics and ethics, religion and economy, recoveries and reappraisals of the history of ethics, and more. The seminar approaches the field in two ways. First, we read large portions of several recently published introductions to the field. This allows us to consider how the field is being understood in the process of handing it on to the next generation. Second, we read and discuss a number of influential recent works in Christian ethics. These works, all of which were published in the last ten years, are meant to give a sense of the breadth and leading edges of the field. Area II and Area V.",

The Christian faith, along with other great spiritual and philosophical traditions, maintained that at least some suffering can be meaningful and salutary. In the course of modernity, we have come to believe, more tacitly than explicitly, that suffering is an unmitigated evil which can and ought to be eliminated. In this course we use philosophical and theological engagements with suffering in order to explore how to respond to suffering, our own and that of others; discern what forms the struggle against suffering should take; and consider whether and, if so, under what conditions suffering may be embraced as an arduous but life-giving good.

But while Luther gave an important place to music, Zwingli and Calvin were much more skeptical. Music, especially sacred music, constituted a problem because it was tightly connected with Catholic liturgical and aesthetic traditions. Reformers had to think about the place music could have in worship and about the function of music in secular life.

Moreover, it is not clear that all understandings of the imago dei lend themselves to undergirding claims to universal human dignity. Nor is it clear that the discourse of human dignity has served to advance human equality, rather than reinforcing the power and privilege of certain groups. In the first half of this course, we consider structural, relational and functional, and developmental understandings of the imago dei as these have emerged in the Christian tradition and consider how these are transformed in the context of Western liberal modernity. In the second half of the course, we turn to contemporary discussions of human dignity against this backdrop and consider the ways in which these debates inform contemporary thought, touching on questions of race, human rights, and animal dignity. We discuss secular critiques of the notion of human dignity, secular analogues to Christian conceptions, and a range of Christian responses.",

Finitude indicates human limitedness and particularity, that we are one thing rather than another and will never be all things. Vulnerability names the universal condition of bodied being; every born thing dies. And risk is everywhere—financial markets, border crossings, susceptibility to illness, asking someone out—yet not everywhere the same. While all are vulnerable, vulnerability is also unequally distributed. Risk both enables and destroys. Finitude can be hard to live with, though there is no other way to live. Is it more important to focus on vulnerability as a universal condition, or on vulnerability's differential distribution along axes of race, class, ethnicity, ability, sexuality, gender identity, nationality (or its absence), age, geographical region, colonial relations, and so on? Or might this either/or present us with a potentially destructive choice that hampers our ability to ameliorate vulnerability's differential distributions? This course examines these concerns, asking what vulnerability means and how it is distributed; how vulnerability is lived and concretely encountered; whether staying close to the real vulnerability and fragility of our lives might help us live together better; and about the value of risk-taking for individual and social change.

Matthew offers much of value for the preacher: narratives illustrating the continuity of God’s redemptive purposes for Israel expressed through centuries-old prophecies and their fulfillment in occupied Palestine under Roman rule; an intricately wrought tapestry of teachings about ethical, missional, and spiritual dimensions of the life of faith, elegantly structured in five great discourses; dramatic storytelling that underscores what is at stake for those who choose ways incongruent with the purposes of God. In this course, we read rich exegetical and literary studies of Matthew by New Testament scholars, and we learn from expert preachers who bring fresh angles from homiletical theory to their engagements with Matthew. Students design and preach sermons and micro-homilies that explore the power of the Gospel of Matthew for Christian communities of conviction.",

Africa is now the continent with the highest population of Christians. This course examines this conundrum through critical engagement with theories, literature, and data from the continent. Students explore the historiographic, political, social, economic, and demographic dimensions of this discussion. They engage with key theories regarding African Christianity in the context of a colonial history. The course surveys contemporary issues in urban, educational, social, and cultural spheres. Additionally, students consider gender perspectives on coloniality as it pertains to religion and politics. The course assesses the role of indigenous impulses in the development of Christianity within contemporary Africa. Through this course, students gain a more nuanced perspective as they examine and problematize critical arguments in the prevailing discourse on Christianity and coloniality in Africa today.

But the course also challenges its own title as misleadingly clear cut, as the boundaries between groups were themselves continuously subject to revision and contestation.

        "description": "The medieval practice of preaching experienced a remarkable shift in the early fourteenth century. Meister Eckhart and John Tauler, two German mystics, preached in vernacular rather than in ecclesiastical Latin. While they were not the first to do so, they shaped a new style that actively engaged their audiences. Metaphors inspired the listeners to embark on a spiritual journey toward God. The mystical framework which both preachers provided aimed to transcend temporal boundaries without dismissing earthly reality. The faithful were invited to view their lives as transcendent for the divine here and now. The preacher became a spiritual guide. Understanding these sermons requires situating them in their historical backdrop, 700 years ago, during a period when the Dominican Order—of which Eckhart and Tauler were members—flourished across Europe. A notable issue for the preachers was addressing women seeking religious knowledge. The sermons reveal that male priests not only taught them but learned from them as well. The old texts might sound foreign in our times. Yet these medieval sermons might encourage us to think more deeply about contemporary ways of preaching and the purposes of homiletical theology writ more broadly. Eckhart’s and Tauler’s sermons on the Gospel of John, as we find them here, are set up to disclose intangible spiritual mysteries and to encourage the faithful to experience God in transformative ways. Their message remains an inspiring call, even today.",

The eminent Protestant Professor of Theology Paul Althaus declared in 1933, \"our Protestant churches have greeted the turning point of 1933 as a gift and miracle of God.\" The roots of Protestant responses to the Third Reich lay in the Imperial Christianity leading to WWI and the chaos of Weimar Germany. Recent scholarship has overturned older narratives of brave resistance and demonstrated that well-known figures such as Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer were anomalies in a Protestant culture of passivity and silence. German Protestant churches remained quiet as Jews were deported. Working with primary sources, students explore the mentalities of collaboration in churches (German Christians) and universities, as well as the character of the Confessing Church. The course concludes with the legacy of collaboration and non-resistance.",

The class then turns to the history of the Methodist movement in America with particular attention paid to the role of gender, race, and polity concerns in the movement from the early societies in the Americas through the creation of The United Methodist church in the mid-twentieth century.

        "description": "African American religion played a significant role in the modern civil rights movement, 1954–1968. It represented one example in the modern historical period that reflected the centrality of religion in shaping political and social movements for and against racial segregation. The modern civil rights movement remains a landmark event in U.S. religious and political history and continues to influence policy debates, movements, and goals in our present moment. In fact, many pundits often privilege the modern civil rights movement as a barometer that determines the essence of Black religion in U.S. history. To be sure, it is impossible to understand the history of the modern civil rights movement without African American religion. Yet American popular narratives focus exclusively on a network of African American male clergy and their mobilizing social action for racial integration obscures a range of people and organizations and consequently theologies and political strategies that also highlight important aspects of African American religion in the historical period. Thus, this course critically examines the faith perspectives of a range of agents and organizations to illuminate the multiplicity and contentiousness that also marked African American religion(s) and the broader modern civil rights movement in the second half of the twentieth century. This course considers the role of Black religion in shaping competing political strategies and goals, leadership models, views on gender and sexuality, and class and urban poverty, from 1954–1968.  The objective of this course aims to deepen our understanding of African American religion and the modern civil rights movement in the later twentieth century by critically engaging a range of historical figures, organizations, ideologies, and events. The course challenges popular, conventional frameworks of Black religion and the modern civil rights movement. Additionally, the course encourages students to rethink Black religion and the civil rights movement in light of our current political moment. Area III.",

The first followers of Jesus shared a life-changing experience that, through Jesus Christ, they had been reconciled with God, and it had been made possible for them to live in their right relationship with God as humanity had not done since before the Fall. That conviction still frames Christians’ understanding of God, Jesus Christ, human existence, and all human relationships. Although Christians have always been convinced that Jesus Christ saves, however, they have debated endlessly how Christ saves. From the earliest writings on, Christians have understood salvation as a form of sacrifice, ransom, rescue, redemption, reconciliation, supplicatory offering, exemplarity, and more. No one image or model has ever been regarded as orthodox at the expense of others, and each contributes something distinctive to the way Christians understand God’s action through Christ. This course combines history and theology to explore the rich diversity of early Christian images, stories, and models of how Christ saves that developed between the first and fifth centuries. We locate different ideas in their Jewish and gentile contexts, investigating where they come from and why they are powerful for different writers and communities. We consider the theological strengths and weaknesses of different ideas and ask why some are more popular than others now. We excavate one long-forgotten model from the New Testament and discuss whether it should be revived. We draw on some modern theologians to ask which ancient models best meet the needs of all those—both sinful and suffering—who need to be reconciled with God. Area I, Area II, and Area III.",

Through a threefold framework of moral analysis, moral articulation, and moral action, students are invited to examine how public theology has impacted the most significant advances in public policy in American history and why pastors and theologians of our time must practice in the tradition of moral leaders who have challenged systemic oppression in the public square and guided critical public policy shifts over the past two centuries. While it is commonplace in American public life to acknowledge that we are, as a people, \"more divided than ever,\" conversations about critical issues impacting our communities are consistently framed by a shared narrative of left versus right, liberal versus conservative, progressive versus traditional. This framing allows for a distorted moral narrative that focuses religious leadership and moral concerns either on a narrow set of personal issues or on wedge issues designed to perpetuate the left/right frame. Religion has been co-opted in American public life to serve the narrow interests of an extreme minority. Throughout this course, students are called to reimagine what public theology and moral action can look like today and how they can apply these historical lessons as they develop their own practice of theology. Area IV and Area V",

        "description": "There is a serious and vigorous public debate about the influence of religious values upon society. What ought to be our social responsibilities, particularly to those who are most vulnerable and in need of support, is a contested issue. The COVID-19 pandemic intensively and sharply reveals the public health crisis before us as well as some of the social and systemic inequities that structure our society and how those inequities impact the lives of people. This course has as its focus the effort to theologically reflect on, and discern from, an interdisciplinary approach to defining \"the disinherited.\" Students explore aspects of the Christian dimensions of social and political reform movements; the contours of faith-based social services; the influence of religious values on individual behavior; and ideas about the role of the church and government in meeting human needs. Through the interests and research of students, the course addresses topics such as poverty; health care disparities; sexual orientation; ethnic, gender, and racial discrimination; hunger; immigration; homelessness; public education; and the welfare of children. Students are expected to develop an interdisciplinary approach from perspectives found in biblical scriptures, sacred texts, theological/religious beliefs and values, social work, sociology of religion, law, psychology of religion, political science, and social welfare theories. In that setting, students contextualize a theological understanding of the disinherited and what might constitute a ministry that addresses the needs of these groups. The learning journey of the course intentionally engages students on three overlapping themes or levels: theological frameworks, personal identity/sense of vocation, and practical tools one uses in living out one’s ministry and/or sense of self in the world. Area IV and Area II.",

This course is designed to help the preacher offer proclamation in ways that speak grace to those who suffer.

Students gain an appreciation for the geographic and demographic scope of Christianity across the globe today. They explore how world Christianity studies represent a rethinking of the nature of Christian expansion, the church, mission, and theology in a post-Western world. The course’s attention to developments in the global South challenges the proprietorial control of mission studies by northern churches in theology, mission, history, and theological education. The readings begin with the influential theories of translation by Lamin Sanneh and Andrew Walls, which shaped the field of World Christianity studies in the late 1980s. From there, the course covers various themes, including history, migration, mission, and contemporary issues.  Students also encounter aspects of indigenous Christian impulses from around the globe, providing insight into diverse expressions of faith. The final two weeks of the course are dedicated to student presentations, where participants will be invited to construct a project applying the readings to an area of the world church with which they are familiar. This hands-on component helps students engage deeply with the material and demonstrate their understanding. Through this course, students develop a comprehensive knowledge base of world Christianity as a field and its relation to mission studies. They gain a greater critical awareness of the diverse contemporary expressions of church around the world and the implications these have for Western church communities. The course encourages students to reflect on significant questions regarding the history of mission and its contemporary relevance to the future of the global church.",

Despite the ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and historical diversity across the continent’s vast geographical expanse, which might seem to work against the notion of a common musical heritage, urban worship provides powerful examples of such a shared heritage. Through popular worship songs sung within and across East, West and Southern regions in Africa, the course examines the interrelated dimensions—conceptual, physical, local, and transnational—that characterize this music. The course also explores the materiality of the music’s lyrics and their centrality to the devotional lives within the highly communal contexts of African urban churches. Overall, the class aims to provide a cross-cultural experience, using music as both the medium of reflection and a means of experiencing the diverse expressions of Christian faith in contemporary Africa.",

What functions does religious language have for different communities of speakers and writers in different contexts and situations? How is religious language appropriated, exploited, and manipulated for political, commercial, and ideological reasons? How can we use frameworks from linguistics and language study to understand and further appreciate the nature, functions, and power of religious language in our own lives and in society in general? These are some of the questions that we explore in this course. Focusing on Christian traditions and the English language, we look at aspects of word choice, metaphor, and other language strategies of religious language, and we use online tools, text collections, and search software to see what makes religious language tick. We draw on genre analysis to see how prayers and sermons as well as eulogies and other genres are put together linguistically (both now and historically) and discuss how knowledge of \"genre language\" can inform our understanding of the parameters of certain genres as well as their creative flexibility. As we look at the details of language and language strategies, we also consider what role religious language plays in creating and maintaining communities (drawing especially on the concept of \"communities of practice\") and how the community function of religious language is exploited by individuals as well as groups for commercial and political reasons. The smaller assignments in the class allow students to explore aspects of religious language that are important to them, and the final project, which can take a number of different shapes, can be adapted to students' particular commitments, whether religious/congregational, non-profit, educational, creative, linguistic, or other.

With some notable exceptions, the course concentrates on modern poetry—that is, poetry written between 1850 and 2013. Inevitably, the course also looks at poetry through the lens of faith, but a working assumption of the course is that a poem is, for a reader (it’s more complicated for a writer), art first and faith second. \"Faith\" in this course generally means Christianity, and that is the primary context for reading the poems. But the course also engages with poems from other faith traditions, as well as with poems that are wholly secular and even adamantly anti-religious. Area V.",

While course content focuses on United States things and religions (given the professor’s areas of expertise and academic appointments), the course also considers broader geographical and categorical parameters so as to invite intellectual engagement with the most challenging and decisive developments in relevant fields, including recent literatures on material agencies. The goal is to investigate possibilities for scholarly examination of a robust human sensorium of sound, taste, touch, scent, and sight—and even \"sixth senses\"—the points where the senses meet material things (and vice versa) in life and practice. Topics include the cultural construction of the senses and sensory hierarchies; investigation of the sensory capacities of things; and specific episodes of sensory contention in and among various religious traditions. In addition, the course invites thinking beyond the \"Western\" five senses to other locations and historical possibilities for identifying the dynamics of sensing human bodies in religious practices, experience, and ideas.",

The course begins with three essays—mourning essays by Freud (1917), Klein (1940), and Fanon (1952)—to which subsequent texts respond in a variety of ways. The course then moves through key texts from the late 1980s to the present. The aim of this course is to familiarize students with key texts in Black feminist, queer, and trans theory, while cultivating appreciation for how texts considered theory are as much singular sites of experience as they are enabling of critical abstraction. The course asks not only how mourning and theorizing (in)form each other, but also how mourning theory orients studies of race, religion, gender, and sexuality and vice versa. Lingering with these questions is crucial for academic and ministerial study committed to critically addressing challenges in today’s world with care. Area V.",

Throughout, we pay attention to meta-philosophical moments where the rationality or irrationality of certain ways of conceiving of the methods and goals of in philosophical explanation and description are entertained.

This course engages students in understanding the factors that shape both exposure to traumatic events and the variability in post-trauma outcomes, with a focus on trauma-related mental health conditions. The first half of the course provides foundational information on the assessment and epidemiology of traumatic events; mental and physical health conditions associated with trauma exposure; biological and sociocultural factors that influence trauma exposure and post-trauma outcomes; and public health and clinical approaches to preventing and mitigating trauma. The second half allows for application of this foundational information to specific trauma types (e.g., sexual violence, disasters), based in part on student interest. Assignments require students to critically evaluate state-of-the-science research on trauma and health; identify and explain an intervention or policy geared toward preventing or mitigating trauma; and synthesize empirical literature on a topic of their choice related to trauma and health.",

Scholars across disciplines recognize that combining these methods allows for deeper insights, richer data interpretation, and a more robust framework for addressing complex research questions. This course provides a systematic introduction to mixed methods research, covering its epistemological foundations, research design, integration strategies, and analytical techniques. Students examine the strengths and limitations of qualitative and quantitative research and explore how these approaches can be effectively combined to enhance research findings. Through the course, they gain both conceptual and practical skills for designing and evaluating mixed methods research. The course explores various mixed methods topics such as integrating epistemological concerns, different types of mixed methods designs, sampling data for mixed methods, or balancing priorities of qualitative and quantitative methods. Ultimately, students apply these concepts by designing a mixed methods research proposal that aligns with their academic interests. Open to graduate students at all levels and from any disciplinary background. This course does not require prior experience with qualitative or quantitative research, though such experience may be beneficial.",

Meaning is approached as both structure and performance, drawing not only on the burgeoning area of cultural sociology but on the humanities, philosophy, and other social sciences. Discussions range widely among methodological, theoretical, empirical, and normative issues. Sessions alternate between presentations by students of their own work and by visitors.

This seminar introduces students to the field of global history through a study of ideas of world order in the twentieth century. As the Eurocentric world order of the nineteenth century was shattered by global conflicts, competing worldmaking projects arose, prompting intellectuals and social scientists to race to comprehend them. The identification or declaration of a certain emerging order was often also a political intervention. Thus, to study the trajectory of the world order in the last century, we need a combined toolkit of international history and intellectual history. After surveying the political and intellectual impacts of the world wars, we will pay special attention to the twin processes of Cold War and decolonization, their origins and their aftermath. Through topics such as war and revolution, modernization and development, nationalism and capitalist globalization, students will be equipped to think critically about contemporary questions: Are we entering a new Cold War? Is empire a thing of the past? Can history inform foreign policy? We will also pay attention to world order as intellectually experienced by historical actors, especially experiences of disorder and imaginations of a new world in an eventful century. With travelers, novelists, and social scientists as well as statesmen as our guides, we will dwell on how moments of crisis and rupture such as global wars and violence, imperial dissolution, and the rapid, uneven development of capitalism gave rise to not only new institutional experiments but also new forms of subjectivity and imagination, all of which help make any idea of order plausible.",

It is the instructor’s contention that the creative process behind most devised theater has more in common with the creative process for contemporary dance than it does with script-based theater, and this seminar allows students to test out that theory and explore its interdisciplinary implications.  At the end of the semester, students are expected to conceive and choreograph/devise a Final Performance Project that is meaningful to them and could potentially serve as the seed for a larger work.",

While focusing on the basic properties of these invariants, methods of computation, and many examples, we also see applications toward proving classical results. These include the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, the Jordan curve theorem, Poincaré duality, and others.

The course hopes to bridge the intensities characteristic of our program: the intensity of the private studio with the intensity of the semi-public critique. We ask crucial questions about the relationships between form and content, between intents and effects, between authorship, authority, and authenticity, between medium specificity and interdisciplinarity, and between risk and failure. How can our ideas and language be tested against the theories of the past and present? Existential, spiritual, and market-based goals (both internal and instrumental motivations) for art making are explored. Meetings alternate between group critique and reading discussion, supplemented by a series of short writing exercises. Enrollment is limited to incoming students in the department, but readings and concepts are shared widely.",

At the core of public health genetics is the rapidly growing science of genetic epidemiology, the study of the role of human genetic variation in determining disease risk in families and populations. This course focuses on the design, analysis, and interpretation of genetic epidemiologic studies. Topics covered include Mendelian laws of inheritance; recombination and linkage disequilibrium; types of genetic variation; molecular technologies for detection of genetic variation; study designs and statistical analysis methods used in genetic epidemiologic studies; and the translation of genetic epidemiologic findings into genetic testing and screening programs. The course provides an understanding of the role of the public health sciences of epidemiology and statistics in the study of human genetics, and of the role of genetics in public health.",

Accordingly, designing efficient hardware architectures for deep neural networks is an important step towards enabling the wide deployment of NNs, particularly in low-power computing platforms, such as, mobiles, embedded Internet of Things (IoT) and drones. This course aims to provide a thorough overview on deep learning techniques, while highlighting the key trends and advances toward efficient processing of deep learning in hardware systems, considering algorithm-hardware co-design techniques.",

The course involves visits to the Yale Art Gallery and focuses on the importance of situating objects within their larger social and cultural context through the analysis of primary source evidence, which may include archaeological, iconographic, epigraphic, and textual sources (Jewish, early Christian, and other contemporary Roman texts). Topics include the literary and archaeological evidence for early Christian attitudes to visual representation; contexts of manufacture; the social and economic basis of patronage; Roman political influence on Christian iconography; development of new genres of imagery; and the role of imperial patronage in the transformation of civic spaces.",

This seminar explores these questions in three parts. Part I examines the structure of the Tang legal system and how it shaped the institutions of both Japan and Korea. Part II focuses on case studies from the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries, showing how these legal systems operated in areas ranging from land disputes to violent acts of revenge. Part III then looks at some of the dramatic changes that began in the late 19th century, as foreign imperial pressure impelled their transition to Western-style laws and court systems.",

There are two options: 1) the lab as a context for innovative film/media/writing projects that do not productively fit into the standard FMS senior courses, or 2) the lab as a supplement to the standard FMS thesis production classes. In this case, the thesis project would be overseen in the standard thesis classes with the lab serving as conceptual and practical development through specifically designed exercises in technique, critique, and conceptual exploration.",

This includes experiments involving calorimetry, electrochemistry, volumetric analysis, computational chemistry, spectroscopy, and synthesis. Students finish with a strong grounding in laboratory safety and experimental design, as well as in the collection and recording of measured and observational data, in addition to exposure to the apparatus and software platforms common to many physical science laboratories. This lab qualifies students for the organic chemistry laboratory sequence (CHEM 222L/223L).",

The MCE is intended to integrate basic and translational research with direct exposure to clinical medicine and patients afflicted with the diseases or conditions under discussion. The course provides a foundation and a critically important forum for class discussion because each module stimulates students to explore a disease process in depth over four ninety-minute sessions led by expert clinician-scientists. The structure incorporates four perspectives to introduce the students to a particular disease or condition and then encourages them to probe areas that are not understood or fully resolved so they can appreciate the value and challenge inherent in using basic science to enhance clinical medicine. Students are provided biomedical resource material for background to the sessions as well as articles or other publicly available information that offers insight to the perspective from the non-scientific world. During this course students meet with patients who have experienced the disease and/or visit and explore facilities associated with diagnosis and treatment of the disease process. Students are expected to prepare for sessions, to participate actively, and to be scrupulously respectful of patients and patient facilities. Prior to one of the sessions students receive guidance as to what they will observe and how to approach the experience; and at the end of the session, the students discuss their thoughts and impressions. All students receive HIPAA training and appropriate training in infection control and decorum relating to patient contact prior to the course.",

We spend the first part of the course considering the theoretical origins of the doppelgänger in gothic literature, turning to concepts of \"the self and other\" from psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial theory to help us think broadly through the category. In the second part of the course, we read works of literature that feature encounters with a large cast of doppelgänger sub-types, including alter-egos, shadows, ghosts, and evil twins. Finally, we revisit the doppelgänger trope in the digital age to interrogate how advanced technologies have altered the possibilities for \"doubling\" through innovations such as AI, cloning, and biogenetic de-extinction projects.",

The author was Indigenous Andean Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala (c. 1535–c. 1616). This work is one of the most important sources for understanding Inka culture and colonial rule from an Indigenous perspective. It consists of 1,189 pages with 398 full-page ink line drawings. Few illustrated manuscripts survive from this period, and Guaman Poma’s has no rival. The New Chronicle was written in Peru in Spanish, Quechua, Aymara, and Latin. But one might even consider the many images a fifth, purely visual language that combined Andean and European representation systems. Its images have become the most common illustrations of Andean history. In this course, we delve into the work’s history and many-layered subtleties of its images to understand its import and the legacy of this Indigenous author.",

The internship program requires students to work at the site of their own choosing, commit to weekly meetings with their assigned on-site supervisor, engage in regular theological reflection with a trained mentor, and participate each week with their practicum group. The Part-time Internship with Practicum is taken for two consecutive terms starting in September—Practicum I in the fall term and Practicum II in the spring term. Ministry-related internship sites may include churches, schools, college campuses, or other institutions. Non-profit /justice focused internships may include a wide range of sites, from youth services to reentry programs, homeless shelters to immigration programs, journalism to retreat centers, and many others. The Part-time Internship with Practicum carries 3 credits each term, and students are offered a stipend. Students are required to complete 400 hours during the year, 370 on site and 30 with the practicum group. This course is open to M.A.R. and M.Div. candidates in their second or third year.

Through a literary journey from the late 18th century to the mid 20th century, students consider how the Russian literary tradition and national identity were shaped by fraught exchanges between Russians and Western Europeans, as well as by Russia’s expansion eastward. We read canonical works by writers who questioned or supported empires and think through ways in which they influenced one another.

To survive, grow, and reproduce, all organisms must acquire energy and avoid conditions that exceed their physiological limits. These interactions all involve motion—ions traveling across membranes, muscle fibers twitching, respiration, and locomotion, to name a few. In this course, we tackle physiological processes from both \"bottom up\" and \"top down\" approaches, with integration among these dimensions, to extract general physiological rules of life. Then, we link our discoveries to the broader context of ongoing global change, and consider whether and how organisms can physiologically respond to contemporary selective pressures.

In order to provide a broad vision of this theme, the course begins by considering influential schools of thought on the definition, origins, and social significance of religious behavior. The course then reviews a variety of methods that scholars may use to reconstruct ancient beliefs and rituals. The course assesses the applicability and success of these methodologies across the broad spectrum of ancient cultures representing differing degrees of sociopolitical complexity. Finally, we explore case studies from a diverse range of ancient societies and consider the impact of religious behaviors within their broader cultural contexts.",

The interplay between probability theory and other fields of study has growing influence on the most recent ideas and developments of research. The aim of this course is to deepen probabilistic education and to prepare for work in the areas of Mathematics related to probability theory. The main topics covered include (time permitting): axiomatic approach and introduction to random structures, limit theorems, random walks and martingales, random point processes, stochastic processes, Brownian motion and basics of Ito calculus, Markov chains and diffusions, introduction to random matrices and to statistical mechanics.",

From Hannah Nikole Jones’ 1619 Project to the first Trump administration’s 1776 Commission, from the \"originalism\" or some members of the United States judiciary to the neo-monarchism of so-called \"dark enlightenment\" thinkers (the Enlightenment itself also being an eighteenth-century movement, if a relatively small one), the politics of our present moment regularly invoke early American history to ground and legitimate their ethical, political, historical, and visionary claims. While this course is primarily an introduction to early American studies—an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the period that draws on scholarship in history, literature, and law, among other fields— the course is organized into three sections, organized around three themes (sovereignty, labor, and governance), and at the end of each section we engage twenty-first century political debates surrounding these themes. This course focuses on British colonial North America, and then the early national United States before 1865, but readings cluster around the long eighteenth century. Topics may include the histories, geographies and politics of Native nations prior to the incursion of Europeans into the region; the labor cultures of bondage (chattel slavery) and indenture; anti-government, anti-monarchical and revolutionary movements; the legal architecture of Native dispossession; the beginnings of nationalist imperialism; the politics of democratic governance; regional, religion-based, and culturally-specific formations of gendered and sexual comportment; visual and/or literary arts of the era; abolitionist movements (temperance, anti-slavery); the creation of citizenship infrastructures as well as those controlling immigration and naturalization; and contemporary visions of what \"Americanness\" meant, looked like, or represented.",

The course ponders freedom's many meanings, from the intimate to the electoral. Land, gendered power and violence, state services, and state abuse are key themes.  Finally, alternative political allegiances and local authorities, often outside the auspices of a formal state, will animate discussions.",

This data is then used for optimal decision-making and control. Cities around the world are adopting \"smart\" technology, thereby transforming urban life. Utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT), cities like Barcelona, London, and Singapore aim to improve living standards, boost the economy, and enhance sustainability. They achieve this through innovations like intelligent streetlights, smart electric grids, and advanced traffic systems. The Internet of Things, a global network consisting of connected sensors, machines, devices, communication networks, and decision-making algorithms is facilitating a new wave of the industrial revolution. This course is designed for both graduate and undergraduate students and offers a comprehensive overview of the key technologies shaping contemporary and future smart cities. It delves into the foundational elements of IoT devices and applications, covering topics such as: data analytics using ML and AI (which will be used to address practical problems); smart sensors and interconnected devices; IoT data: formats, transmission, and storage; Cloud and Edge computing, and the associated trade-offs; connectivity and wireless communication technologies; device failure prevention and reliability modeling; and other relevant subjects.",

        "description": "Policy modeling refers to applications of operations research and allied quantitative methods to policy problems. Policy modeling is most useful when the amounts of data, money, time, and other resources one would like for purely scientific investigation are highly constrained by the decision-making environment. Recognizing that analyses of all sorts often exhibit diminishing returns in insight to effort, the idea is to capture key features of various policy issues with relatively simple \"first-strike\" models that provide support for decision making. Building on earlier coursework in probability modeling, decision analysis and economics, the techniques introduced include \"back of the envelope\" probabilistic models such as Bernoulli, Poisson, Markov and elementary renewal processes, hazard functions, queueing theory, and epidemic modeling. Simple cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness approaches are integrated with the above. This year the course will feature several applications to the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2, the causal virus of COVID-19, in addition to problems drawn from other areas of public health, criminal justice, public housing, and counterterrorism. Students will be responsible for attending lectures and reading assigned articles. There will be weekly problem sets which must be submitted on-time to receive credit, and a take-home exam scheduled for the latter part of the semester. Prerequisite: Students must have completed MGT 403 (Probability Modeling and Statistics) or equivalent to take this class. The probability modeling knowledge required is covered in any introductory probability course and includes: sample space, event probabilities including marginal, joint and conditional, Bayes' Rule, random variables, probability distributions, expected value, mean, variance, Bernoulli, binomial, uniform, and normal random variables, joint distributions, independence, covariance and correlation, sums of random variables (both independent and dependent), central limit theorem, and sampling distributions. Policy modeling is not a class in statistics or econometrics.",

This course has a mandatory weekly lab meeting most Tuesdays from 6:30p-9:30p. This course also has a mandatory off-campus weekend retreat (see dates below). Studies have shown that the average manager spends about two-thirds of their time interacting with others. It should be no surprise that skill in interpersonal relationships is one of the most frequent determinants of managerial success or failure. This course is designed to help students learn some of the skills necessary for successfully navigating and leading in the face of fast-paced, complex human interaction. The central focus is to increase students' ability to understand and diagnose interpersonal dynamics as well as to increase personal understanding of how they impact others. This course is a memory-making, powerful and even transformational experience for many students. While readings and group exercises are used to begin discussion, the core learning material emerges in small group interaction. Students learn how they function in small groups and how they relate to others from feedback and reaction of other class members. As such, students planning to enroll should understand that the course methodologies are likely quite different than most courses you have taken to date. Much of the learning will emerge from a) personal reflection on interpersonal and group dynamics and b) the ability/willingness to learn interpersonally from experience, risk-taking, self-disclosure, and feedback. Interested students are encouraged to attend first session to better understand this unique course experience. Attendance is required for the first two classes to retain a place in the course or on the waiting list. This course has a mandatory weekly lab meeting most Tuesdays from 6:30p-9:30p. This course also has a mandatory off-campus weekend retreat scheduled for November 1st at 6 pm – to November 3rd at 3 pm, 2024. Outside of the required course meetings, reading and writing- almost all of the course demand takes place in person. More information available at https://faculty.som.yale.edu/heidibrooks/",

Even China, which retained its Communist political system, joined the capitalist economic order with a vengeance at home and abroad. The end of the Cold War also reshaped business-government relations in the West, as the threatening shadow of an alternative to capitalism \"out there\" vanished. The neo-liberal resurgence, which had seen extensive deregulation plus privatization of government monopolies in the 1980s, gathered momentum. Financial markets were freed up and privatization extended to core government functions like prisons and the military.  Gated communities proliferated, spawning novel forms of private local government. Business took on new roles in developing counties as well, filling gaps in public service provision from weak states, and sometimes even reshaping political regimes themselves.",

Please note that in order to enroll in the course, you must attend the first class meeting. Additionally, please note that there will be an assignment due prior to the first class. Course description: Finance can be likened to the circulatory system of the global economy, and we will focus on the past, present and future of that system. The course is designed to deal with questions such as these: What is the global financial system and how does it work? What are the pressures on that system including market, regulatory, political and social dynamics? What are the key challenges to that system? How can the system be strengthened? In this course we are defining the global financial system (GFS) as encompassing central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions such as asset managers and private equity firms, financial regulators and international organizations. Thus we will encompass subjects such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, Goldman Sachs and the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, the Carlyle Group and the BlackRock Investment Management Co., the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Financial Stability Board, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund. We will take a broad view of the GFS including its history, its geopolitical framework, its economic foundations and its legal underpinnings. We will consider the GFS as a critical public good in the same way that clean air is a public good. We will look at a number of other key issues such as how the GFS deals with economic growth, economic and financial stability, distributional questions, employment issues, and long term investments in infrastructure. We will discuss how new technologies are affecting several of the biggest issues in global finance. We will examine the GFS as a large-scale complex network, thereby compelling us to see it in an interconnected and multidisciplinary way. The emphasis will be on the practice of global finance more than the theory.",

Quarterly earnings, the 24hr news cycle, and social media blips command much of if not most attention. Yet the opportunity set facing business is overwhelmingly shaped by broad macro-trends and systemic risks – call them \"big issues.\" Climate change, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and urbanization are just some of the trends that will make some industries rise while others fall; challenge managers to reinvent their companies, products, and even themselves; and provide exciting opportunities for global leaders who are change agents and entrepreneurs. At the same time, because of business’s ability to adapt to and even steer major change, many stakeholders are looking to the business community to help solve global problems. To meet stakeholder expectations, and to ultimately convert global challenges into business opportunities, aspiring leaders must understand an array of issues that extend far beyond traditional business concerns. Only then can they create ‘shared value’ at the nexus of business and society. This course is designed to foster participants’ ability to think more holistically about globalization, global trends, and the role of business. It is structured around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of 17 objectives, backed up by 169 specific targets, that were adopted by the UN in 2015 after broad-based consultations involving governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academics, and the business community.\"",

This course helps you acquire basic accounting and finance knowledge that is extremely useful in the day-to-day practice of general management, consulting, investment banking—virtually any career path that you may pursue. Accounting systems provide important financial information for all types of organizations. Despite their many differences, all accounting systems are built on common foundations. Economic concepts, such as assets, liabilities, and income are used to organize information into a fairly standard set of financial information. Bookkeeping mechanics compile financial information with the double entry system of debits and credits. Accounting conventions help guide the application of the concepts through the mechanics. This course provides these fundamentals of accounting. The financial valuation part of the course helps students to understand the financial environment in which firms operate and the concepts that need to be mastered in order to make decisions that benefit the stakeholders of a typical organization. The time value of money and net present values and their application to the valuation of bonds and stocks, the trade-off of risk and return in financial markets, the computation of the cost of obtaining capital for investment, and how firms balance the use of equity and debt to finance their activities, are all topics to be considered in this class. The course has been specifically designed to provide the requisite fundamentals of accounting and valuation for students that do not currently have access to SOM’s core courses. The aim has been to provide an introduction to the material relied upon by elective courses.\"\"\"",

The course topics includes: (1) measurements and theoretical explanations of poverty, incorporating both panel data and ethnography; (2) analytic tools for assessing community and regional economic flows; and (3) strategies for economic development and wealth building among the low income urban populations and communities. We examine innovative approaches in the traditional areas of economic development practice areas of business creation and development, workforce development and skills training, housing, education, and individual income support and wealth building. Strategies to explore include: place based anchor strategies, cluster development with inclusive economic aims in mind, sector strategies for workforce development training, worker ownership, affordable housing and community land trusts, and asset building strategies. The course is designed to give students both a broad overview of theory, research, policy and current trends in urban poverty and community development through the readings, guest lectures and case based discussions, and the opportunity to self-direct their exploration of the an aspect of the economic development literature covered in the course literature more deeply through the course assignment.",

Will the outcome of the next election affect the value of my stock portfolio? This course will examine when and how data can be used specifically to infer whether there is a causal relationship between two variables. We will emphasize the role of theory in interpreting data and guiding analysis, and explore advanced techniques for inferring causality, including: regression discontinuity designs; matching estimators; instrumental variables; synthetic controls; event studies; heterogeneity modeling; audit studies; randomized controlled trials; natural experiments (and unnatural experiments); and A/B testing. Lectures will contain some proofs and derivations (only calculus is required), but the emphasis will be on understanding the underlying concepts, and the practical use, implications and limitations of these techniques. Students will work intensively with data, drawing from examples in business and public policy. The goals of the course are for students to become expert consumers and producers of convincing causal empirical analysis.\"\"\"",

MAM and MMS students must get instructor approval) This course introduces the principles of marketing management as practiced by industry leaders today. Although the implementation of marketing programs is undergoing a massive transformation from conventional to digital media, the underlying principles of consumer driven marketing remain essentially the same; we will discuss how great marketing, including digital programming, is driven by a sound understanding of consumer segmentation, brand positioning, distinct product benefits, and relevant in-market executions. Upon completion of this course, you should understand essential marketing concepts and use them to develop marketing strategies. You will develop this understanding through core readings, basic frameworks, and case studies involving firms such as Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Unilever, Porsche, Nestle, Sephora, and Glossier. This course is relevant for students interested in driving consumer demand regardless of career path. There are no prerequisites.

The course will examine operational, organizational and financial issues that are prevalent in developing small and medium businesses. Cases will examine startups, acquired companies, family businesses and sponsored businesses (private equity owned). Not for profits will also be considered. The course will focus on the developing and adolescent stages of the business – beyond start up and prior to maturity or exit. The size of the businesses will roughly be $2m to $100m in annual revenue. Students will discover that organizations of this size can be resource constrained, lack infrastructure and will require innovative and creative solutions and strategies to grow and create value. The general nature of the course will give students a complete view of the enterprise and an understanding of what choices can be made to grow the enterprise, improve the enterprise, finance the businesses and create value. Students will be required to assess the current situation of the enterprise and its leader, diagnose the challenges and opportunities and make specific recommendations and action plans with quantitative and qualitative support. Students will learn new skills and concepts while analyzing the cases and will also draw upon the Core foundation. The course will provide students with an opportunity to understand what it is like to lead, run, grow and manage a smaller organization and how this might fit as a career choice.

We develop the theory of algebraic curves including divisors, Hurwitz's theorem, Riemann-Roch theorem, Jacobians, and Abel-Jacobi theory. We also discuss some aspects of higher dimensional varieties.",

Global investment in financial assets, the need for risk diversification, the increased accuracy of property records, greater transparency, more relaxed laws permitting foreign investment, and population movement around the world—all of these trends have led to a tremendous increase in cross-border real estate investing for both private equity and public companies. While many studies of international real estate focus on the role of foreign real property in the U. S. institutional portfolio, this course will take a wider and more historical view of the cultural attitudes towards real estate around the world and how they impact the quality and risk of investment assets. Detailed analysis will begin with property level due diligence in order to provide a fundamental understanding of how and why property markets differ by country beyond simple supply/demand dynamics. This course will consist of three parts: a.) a micro-market analysis of real property characteristics in various countries around the world, including financing, leasing and valuation; b.) an analysis of investment vehicles—public and private—available to institutional investors, as well as cross-border transactions, and c.) a macro-market view of world space and capital markets, the rationale for international investing, trends in capital flows and portfolio composition and the various ways in which risk is measured and mitigated. Each part of the course will require a brief individual assignment completed over a two-week period. The first research project will be a study of a significant real property asset outside of the United States, including its market, ownership, legal structure, valuation, and transaction history. Both the G-8 and G-20 nations will be the object of study, but individual students are free to concentrate on any country of interest. The second research project will consist of an analysis of a private equity or publicly-traded foreign property company, its current fair value, competitive advantage and future prospects. An interview with a top executive of a company will be encouraged and facilitated. The third research project will consist of a comparative analysis of world property markets and the hypothetical investment in a portfolio of real estate assets across three or more foreign property markets. The course will consist of lectures, discussion, case studies and readings on international real estate from a variety of sources. No final exam or group project will be required.",

We will discuss \"agile\", continuous delivery, \"devops\", and related management practices. Along the way, students will acquire elementary software development skills for creating consumer web applications including both front-end development (typically HTML, JavaScript and CSS) and back-end development (typically Google’s Go language). The coursework in MGT656 typically includes homework (mostly programming assignments completed individually), pre-class quizzes, in-class exams, and a group final project. Some experience programming is beneficial, though not necessary for the motivated student. The course is open to all Yale students. In some semesters MGT660 is offered as an advanced version of this course. For more information, see the class website at http://656.mba (offline between semesters).",

However, the reality is challenging. Entrepreneurs find it tough, with 30% of galleries running at a loss and over 90% of artists unable to live from their work. How can entrepreneurs succeed? Why does Gagosian turn over a billion while the average gallery makes only $200k? What impact will Web3 have? Can new models replace auction houses and art fairs? This course offers students firsthand insights into the art market through theoretical analysis and guest experts. Past speakers included Jeff Koons, KAWS, and Noah Horowitz (CEO of Art Basel). Students will shape these sessions, challenge the experts, and develop their own perspectives. Fifteen slots are reserved for artists from the Yale School of Art, fostering a uniquely diverse and enriching classroom experience.",

Although central banks around the world are broadly similar in terms of their mandates and policy instruments, emerging market central banks are different by way of the policy trade-offs they face, the degrees of freedom available to them and the environment in which they operate. As the global economic center of gravity shifts towards the emerging world, an intelligent appreciation of emerging economy perspectives is imperative for acquiring a broad-based worldview of the global economy. In that light, the course will focus on the challenges and dilemmas of central banking in emerging markets. Drawing from international, particularly emerging market experience of the last two decades, the course will prioritize practice over theory and breadth over depth.

In the second half of the course, we will introduce simulation modeling, a useful tool for guiding decisions under uncertainty.

Modeling concepts covered include linear programming (LP), network LP, integer LP, non-linear optimization methods, Monte Carlo simulation methods, estimating summary statistics using simulation, and accuracy and precision in simulation models. The course will be taught with a collection of interactive examples, ample opportunities for in-class implementation and practice, followed by lectures, discussion, and debrief.

        "description": "Finance is more than just a mechanism for wealth generation; it is a pivotal force that shapes societal structures, influences government policies, and changes social norms. The distribution and management of financial resources can dramatically affect the quality of life, access to opportunities, the overall social fabric of communities, as well as geopolitics. In recent decades, private capital, including private equity, infrastructure and private credit, has become a significant player in society. Private equity managers control tens of trillions of assets. Large pools of sovereign and private wealth emerge, compete for private assets, accumulate returns and gain influence. Private capital not only fuels businesses and innovation but also holds significant influence over public policy and social norms. Understanding the dynamics of private capital is crucial for anyone looking to make informed decisions within the financial sector or engage in policy-making that affects economic growth and social equity. This course is designed for students in finance, economics, public policy, and anyone interested in the intersection of finance and societal development. It offers insights into how financial instruments and decisions can be harnessed to promote sustainable and equitable growth. By examining both the positive and negative impacts of private capital, the course prepares students to contribute thoughtfully and effectively in their future careers, whether in finance, regulation, or social entrepreneurship. The course is co-taught by Professor Song Ma and Dr. Kevin Lu. Song Ma is a Professor of Finance at Yale School of Management. Kevin Lu is a Partner and Chairman of Asia at Partners Group, a global private equity firm with $147 billion AUM. A preliminary syllabus of the course can be found at: https://songma.github.io/teaching/YaleSOM_MGT844_SampleSyllabus.pdf",

The course focuses on drivers of unsustainability and obstacles to sustainable food systems that meet food security in terms of food availability, accessibility, and utilization. The course takes a solutions-oriented approach to illustrating the ways in which food systems transformation is uniquely positioned to holistically address the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. It examines the multiplicity of entry points that food systems transformation offers for fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth, reversing harmful environmental trends, and enhancing the resilience of the poorest and most vulnerable populations. The course explores tensions at play notably how small-scale farmers often practice unsustainable agriculture so that they can continue their livelihoods while their sustainable future is threatened. We explore the effects of climate change and how to build resilience in agriculture and food systems. Through weekly readings, discussions, and problem- solving sessions, students are equipped with the knowledge and tools required to apply systems thinking to complex food systems challenges in an integrated manner for people, the planet, prosperity, and peace.",

The strategies of inquiry of qualitative research we learn about include ethnography, oral history, participatory action research, and case study research.

The exercise of legal authority to plan and regulate the development and conservation of privately owned land plays a key role in meeting the needs of the nation’s growing population for equitable housing, energy, and nonresidential development as well as ensuring that critical environmental functions are protected from the adverse impacts of land development. This course explores the multifaceted discipline of land use and urban planning and their associated ecological implications. Numerous land use strategies are discussed, including identifying and defining climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, including affordable housing, community revitalization, energy development and siting, equitable community engagement, transit-oriented development, building and neighborhood energy conservation, distressed building remediation, jobs and housing balance, coastal resiliency, and biological carbon sequestration. The course also explores how recent events impact these planning issues. The focus is on exposing students to the basics of land use and urban planning, especially in the United States but also internationally, and serving as an introduction for a YSE curricular concentration in land use. The majority of classes highlight guest speakers who are professionals involved in sustainable development, land conservation, smart growth, renewable energy, and climate change management. Some synchronized classes are held online to accommodate guest speakers around the country and outside of the US.",

We approach philosophy not just as a body of knowledge but as an active, lived practice that takes many forms. Through readings, dialogue, and exercises, we both theoretically examine and actively imitate a range of philosophical traditions and methods—from meditation to debate, and dialogue to personal letters. As we explore these ways of doing philosophy, we consider how the form of a philosophical practice shapes the ideas and arguments that come out of that practice. By the end of this course, you gain a deeper appreciation of philosophy as a multifaceted and multitudinous practice, as well as a clearer sense of how you can integrate philosophical practice into your own life.",

The racialized slavery that emerged in the Americas was new to World History, developed by European colonists to exploit the natural resources of the Americas. Initially, European colonists enslaved indigenous peoples wherever possible, yet by the late sixteenth century the enslavement of Africans had become far more common. We focus upon North American and the Caribbean, where European colonists developed sophisticated agricultural enterprises that produced for export to the European market and were completely dependent upon the enslaved labor of Africans. An enormous ocean commerce trafficked almost twelve million enslaved captives from the Atlantic coasts of Africa to work on the plantations of the Americas. The commerce in tobacco, sugar, rum, and cotton enabled these colonies to develop. Black people resisted enslavement at multiple levels, and throughout the Americas there emerged the Black cultures, languages, musics, struggles, and histories that we know and love today.",

Will the outcome of the next election affect the value of my stock portfolio? This course will examine when and how data can be used specifically to infer whether there is a causal relationship between two variables. We will emphasize the role of theory in interpreting data and guiding analysis, and explore advanced techniques for inferring causality, including: regression discontinuity designs; matching estimators; instrumental variables; synthetic controls; event studies; heterogeneity modeling; audit studies; randomized controlled trials; natural experiments (and unnatural experiments); and A/B testing. Lectures will contain some proofs and derivations (only calculus is required), but the emphasis will be on understanding the underlying concepts, and the practical use, implications and limitations of these techniques. Students will work intensively with data, drawing from examples in business and public policy. The goals of the course are for students to become expert consumers and producers of convincing causal empirical analysis.\"\"\"",

In this course we are defining the global financial system (GFS) as encompassing central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions such as asset managers and private equity firms, financial regulators, and international organizations. Thus the course encompasses subjects such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, Goldman Sachs and the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, the Carlyle Group and the BlackRock Investment Management Co., the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Financial Stability Board, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund. We take a broad view of the GFS including its history, geopolitical framework, economic foundations, and legal underpinnings. We consider the GFS as a critical public good in the same way that clean air is a public good. We look at a number of other key issues such as how the GFS deals with economic growth, economic and financial stability, distributional questions, employment issues, and long-term investments in infrastructure. We discuss how new technologies are affecting several of the biggest issues in global finance. We examine the GFS as a large-scale complex network, thereby compelling us to see it in an interconnected and multidisciplinary way. The emphasis is on the practice of global finance more than the theory. The course is open to graduate students throughout Yale and to seniors in Yale College. It follows the SOM academic calendar.",

        "description": "This course will provide students with an opportunity to explore being a CEO, owner, entrepreneur of an emerging small or medium enterprise. The course will examine operational, organizational and financial issues that are prevalent in developing small and medium businesses. Cases will examine startups, acquired companies, family businesses and sponsored businesses (private equity owned). Not for profits will also be considered. The course will focus on the developing and adolescent stages of the business – beyond start up and prior to maturity or exit. The size of the businesses will roughly be $2m to $100m in annual revenue. Students will discover that organizations of this size can be resource constrained, lack infrastructure and will require innovative and creative solutions and strategies to grow and create value. The general nature of the course will give students a complete view of the enterprise and an understanding of what choices can be made to grow the enterprise, improve the enterprise, finance the businesses and create value. Students will be required to assess the current situation of the enterprise and its leader, diagnose the challenges and opportunities and make specific recommendations and action plans with quantitative and qualitative support. Students will learn new skills and concepts while analyzing the cases and will also draw upon the Core foundation. The course will provide students with an opportunity to understand what it is like to lead, run, grow and manage a smaller organization and how this might fit as a career choice. This course will require active participation in class. Please be prepared and committed to participate in class. If you do not enjoy participating in class, this might not be the right course for you. Official and unofficial auditing is not permitted. Please see the Registrar’s Office (not the instructor) for all enrollment, registration, and auditing questions.",

At the same time, Christianity has continued to grow rapidly in post-independence Africa. In much of Africa south of the Sahara, decolonization efforts coincided with the period of the greatest Christian expansion in history. Africa is now the continent with the highest population of Christians. This course examines this conundrum through critical engagement with theory, literature, and data from the continent. Students examine historiographic, political, social, economic, and demographic dimensions of this discussion. They meet key theories posited with regard to African Christianity in the wake of a colonial history. The course surveys contemporary issues in the discourse within the urban, educational, social, and cultural spheres. Students also consider gender perspectives on coloniality as it pertains to religion and politics. The course assesses the role of indigenous agency in the development of Christianity within contemporary Africa. Through this course students will gain a more nuanced perspective as they examine and problematize critical arguments in the prevailing discourse on Christianity and coloniality in Africa today.

        "description": "Few societies have been as reliant on experts as our own. As societies grow more complex and technology advances, so does the need for experts who have undergone years of specialized training. Ordinary citizens, firms, state bureaucracies, courts, and legislators constantly rely on experts to guide them in their decisions. However, this reliance is far from seamless. Opportunities to become a successful expert are uneven and often depend on circumstances beyond individual control. Specialists must counter public skepticism and compete with rival groups to establish their authority. Decision-makers are inundated with claims to expertise, making it challenging to discern between valid and dubious advice. Experts can exacerbate issues, fail catastrophically, or neglect public concerns to serve their own interests. Moreover, the increasingly specialized knowledge possessed by experts can seem esoteric and detached from everyday life, leader laypeople to view them with suspicion. For these reasons and others, the very notion of expertise has become highly politicized in recent years. Our society seems to be more and more divided between those who think that experts are indispensable to solve our problems, and those who see them as the root of our troubles. The course adopts an interdisciplinary perspective to explore these issues, drawing from both classical and modern research in sociology, political science, psychology, and philosophy.",

Understanding the deep interconnections between race and law, and how race and law are co-constitutive, is the project of critical race theory. One of the central claims of critical race theory is that racial subordination is not a deviation from the liberal legal ideal but is, unfortunately, part of its expression. We focus on the origins of the critique that is central to the development of the theory and contrast its analysis with conventional analytic frameworks on race and American law and society. Because it is a positive theory but also driven by a normative vision, we explore the possibility of transforming the relationship between law and racial power. The law is not the only site of critical race theory; it has had a significant impact on other disciplines in the social sciences. We examine those impacts as well.",

The course seeks to provide students with an introduction to the range of sustainability issues and challenges that companies face in today’s fast-changing marketplace. It introduces key corporate sustainability terms, concepts, tools, strategies, and frameworks based on the overarching theory that the traditional profit-maximizing mission of business (often called shareholder primacy) is giving way to a new vision of stakeholder responsibility that still seeks to provide good returns to the enterprise’s owners but also acknowledges obligations to employees, suppliers, customers, communities, and society more broadly. The course combines lectures, case studies, and class discussions on management theory and tools, the legal and regulatory frameworks that shape the business-environment interface, and the evolving role of business in society. It explores how to deal with a world of diverse stakeholders, increasing transparency, and rising expectations related to corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance.

It examines how race and class interact in American rural and urban environments to produce or sustain inequalities. The course examines how structural factors and community characteristics influence environmental outcomes. Students begin by examining the relationship between degraded environments and poor schooling. They examine the environmental hazards that exist in or adjacent to urban and rural public schools. Students will analyze inner-city and poor rural communities as they examine disinvestment, the concentration of poverty, efforts to disperse the poor, and the potential for community revitalization. Students examine homelessness and the ways in which climate disasters impact housing experiences. The course also examines another aspect of poverty: the issue of food security; it looks at the rise in community gardening in poor communities as an attempt to combat lack of access to healthy food. Students examine residential segregation and zoning and study the spatial inequalities that arise from the siting of hazardous facilities in minority and low-income urban and rural communities. The course examines the classic environmental justice question: which came first the facilities or the people? It examines economic questions related to costs of hosting noxious facilities and if and how communities can seek compensation to host such facilities. The course also examines the quandary communities face when presented with economic models that seek to provide compensation – the question of the long-term health of the people and environment takes center stage as community residents seek to determine how to balance economic development with concerns about sustainability. Students analyze water, energy, and climate justice.",

Students study how markets work to allocate scarce resources. This includes consideration of how individuals and firms make decisions, and how policy analysts seek to quantify the benefits and costs of consumption and production. We consider the conditions under which markets are beneficial to society and when they fail. We see that market failure arises frequently in the context of environmental and natural resource management. The last part of the course focuses on the design of environmental and natural resource policies to address such market failures. The course is designed to cover basic knowledge of economics analysis and prepare students for ENV 834 and other more advanced offerings.",

However, many graduate students have not taken a math course in years, and their math skills are rusty. Furthermore, many graduate-level mathematical concepts may be entirely new. Experience suggests that many students either opt out of taking courses they are truly interested in or muddle through, struggle with the math, and miss important concepts. FAME is meant to help students refresh or acquire new math skills and succeed in content and provide a foundational \"toolbox\" for graduate-level courses. FAME provides a structured opportunity to learn a range of mathematical concepts used in environmental research. The course assumes that, at a minimum, students took college algebra (and have been exposed to calculus). Concepts are presented heuristically in a \"how to\" and \"why\" approach with examples from environmental research and policy questions. The goal is for students to be conversant and have intuition about (i.e., to demystify) why logs, exponents, derivatives, integrals. Also covered is a bit of history of math and an introduction to computer programming.",

This fall series focuses on scientific forestry, from sustained yield to ecosystem management. The second part in this series explores the history of \"scientific forestry,\" tracing its origins in early-modern European views of nature, where scientific expertise was seen as a tool for dominion over the natural world and its colonial expansion. The course examines how European forestry practices influenced the development of forestry in the United States during the nineteenth century and how the profession gained ground in North American universities (including with the founding of the Yale Forest School in 1900). Focusing on the twentieth century, we trace the transformation of forestry from its early focus on protection and recovery of forests in the West to timber and sustained yield forest management particularly in the South and far West to the development of an ecosystem and ecological approach to managing our nation’s forests. Through this lens, we evaluate forestry in the United States by considering its successes and also its problematic legacies in relation to Native American dispossession and settler colonialism. From the Eastern United States in the colonial period to the upper Midwest and eventual expansion to the US South and Pacific Northwest in the early twentieth century, we follow the roots of land use and forestry and explore how the profession evolved with advances in modern genetics and ecosystem forestry, culminating in the watershed legislation of the 1970s, including NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Forest Management Act, which laid the foundation for a new era in forest management.",

        "description": "The basic premise of this course is that water is about power. Water problems around the world are not being experienced equally by different sectors of society but rather reflect—and exacerbate—underlying current and historical power asymmetries among different communities and identities. These inequalities are not limited to the issue of water rights (who gets how much water) but can be found across the whole range of water issues, from water quality to flooding to the impacts of dams. Likewise, these inequalities are reflected not just in the rules that determine water distribution, but also in the infrastructure, institutions, information, and incentives that form the basis of water management. This course explores the complex intersections of water access, equity, and environmental sustainability rights, and environmental justice. It examines historical and contemporary issues surrounding water distribution, policymaking, and the impact on marginalized communities. Through case studies and critical analysis, students engage with environmental justice, policymaking, and community action concepts, aiming to foster a deeper understanding of the need for equitable water distribution and governance in a changing climate.",

A reliable electricity infrastructure is essential for the U.S. economy and the health and safety of its citizens. The electric industry also has a significant impact on the environment. In the United States, electric power generation is responsible for about 40 percent of human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas. Electric utilities in the United States are at a crossroads. Technological innovations, improving economics, and regulatory incentives provide a transformational opportunity to implement demand-side resources and distributed energy technologies that will both lower emissions and improve service to customers. Such significant changes could, however, disrupt existing utility business models and therefore may not be fully supported by incumbent utilities. This course focuses on the issues, challenges, risks, and trade-offs associated with moving the U.S. utility industry toward a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. We explore how utilities are regulated and how economic factors and regulatory policies influence outcomes and opportunities to align customer, environmental, and utility shareholder interests to craft win-win-win solutions.",

Green buildings seek to minimize environmental impacts, strengthen the fabric of our cities and towns, and make our work and our homes more productive and fulfilling. This course is an applied course, exploring both the technical and the social-business-political aspects of buildings. Topics range from building science (hygrothermal  performance of building enclosures) to indoor environmental quality; from product certifications to resilience (robust buildings and communities in the face of disasters and extended service outages). The purpose of the course is to build a solid background in the processes and issues related to green buildings, equipping students with practical knowledge about the built environment. Extensive use is made of resources from BuildingGreen, Inc., one of the leading information companies supporting green building and green building professionals. The course takes a \"joint-discovery\" approach with substantial emphasis on research and group project work, some fieldwork, and online individual testing. There are too many topics within green building to cover in one term, so the course is broken down into two sections. The first six weeks focus on the following topics, led by the instructor and/or an expert guest lecturer: building science, materials, indoor environmental quality, rating programs and systems, resilience, systems integration. The second half of the course focuses on selected topics driven by students and their particular interest/academic focus. The class meets once a week, with the instructor available to students that same day. Enrollment limited to twenty.",

The course explores the complex relationship between climate change and migration, focusing on hands-on quantitative and qualitative data manipulation and analysis of the attribution of environmental/climate change drivers, the experiences of migrants, the responses of host communities, and the rise of a conservative, negative narrative on climate migration. Legal frameworks and human rights perspectives are central to understanding the challenges and opportunities for climate migrants. At the end of the course, we expect students to gain a deeper understanding of the diverse challenges and opportunities within attribution science, as well as the human rights, policy, political, and financial frameworks at the intersection of climate change and migration, through data preprocessing, the use of different tools, analysis, documenting and writing. The course enables students to develop the skills and perspectives needed to pursue inclusive, interactive, solution-oriented approaches to climate migration challenges.",

The course is structured around weekly guest lectures and discussions, anchored by a public webinar series hosted by the Yale Forest Forum (YFF). Each week’s YFF webinar will be followed by a seminar session with the invited speaker(s), allowing for deeper discussion and critical engagement. This seminar examines foundational issues in forest carbon accounting and crediting, focusing on both major critiques and proposed solutions. Topics include the following: selecting baselines and assessing additionality, incorporating digital measurements and remote sensing, addressing permanence and leakage, and exploring new frontiers in accounting, such as adjusting for albedo effects and non-climate feedback, temporary accounting measures, and jurisdictional accounting. For many sessions, students hear from researchers with emerging ideas on how to improve carbon accounting as well as perspectives from those engaged in financing and producing carbon credits about the opportunities and challenges of incorporating evolving methods into existing crediting schemes.",

A wide range of CDR technologies are currently in development, yet this nascent field must overcome many technical, logistical, ethical, and financial challenges before contributing to the stabilization of the climate at scale. In the first half of this course, we examine the need, scale, and timelines for CDR, study the landscape of strategies in development, and workshop a framework for evaluating carbon removal approaches. In the latter half of the course, we discuss specific pathways in detail, including (but not limited to): direct air carbon capture (DACC), enhanced mineral weathering, ocean alkalinity enhancement, and biomass carbon removal and storage (BiCRS). Course instructors and invited entrepreneurs lecture on the mechanics, risks, and potentials of each pathway and engage student questions and discussion. Active participation in discussion is a requirement. Students gain a deeper understanding of CDR drivers, approaches, co-benefits, and challenges. After examining the key challenges, trade-offs, and opportunities, students should be better able to make informed decisions about how CDR can best complement other decarbonization strategies and environmental justice priorities.

What you write during the term is driven entirely by your own interest and attention. How you write is the question at hand. We explore the overlapping habitats of language—present and past—and the natural environment. And, to a lesser extent, we explore the character of persuasion in environmental themes. Every member of the class writes every week, and we all read what everyone writes every week. It makes no difference whether you are a would-be journalist, scientist, environmental advocate, or policy maker. The goal is to rework your writing and sharpen your perceptions, both sensory and intellectual. Enrollment limited to fifteen.",

Working in teams directly with local community-based non-profits, students cocreate detailed development proposals and architectural designs anchored by affordable housing and which may also engage with a range of community development issues including environmental justice, sustainability, resilience, social equity, identity, food scarcity, mobility, and health. Through seminars and workshops with Yale faculty and guest practitioners, students are introduced to the history, theory, issues, and contemporary practices in the field and get direct feedback on their work. Offered in partnership with the Connecticut Department of Housing (DOH) as part of the Connecticut Plan for Healthy Cities, student projects center on community wealth building and equitable economic recovery by proposing multi-sector, place-based projects that focus on housing, health, and economic development. Proposals may have the opportunity to receive funding from the State of Connecticut both towards the implementation of rapidly deployed pilot projects during the course period, as well as towards predevelopment activities for larger projects, such as housing rehabilitation or new building construction.",

The weekly class time focuses on experiential exercises in making studies and more significant works, workshops from visiting artists, workshares, and studio visits. Working with a range of materials and techniques, from building our substrates out of found objects to traditional approaches, we aim to stay open and discover outcomes to processes that may be surprising or calculated. May we never take for granted what’s on the surface of the work we encounter. Open to all M.F.A. students.",

        "description": "This seminar invokes the art of ventriloquism as a lens through which to engage contemporary painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking, architecture, video, installation, and interdisciplinary practice. Engaging with issues of voice, embodiment, power, and projection, the case studies in this course both examine and enact ventriloqual practices, and do so as a means of interrogating and performatively bearing out contemporary conceptions of authorship, subjectivity, and performance. With historical roots in religious and spiritual practices dating to antiquity, ventriloquism became popular as a theatrical practice in the nineteenth century, with stage performers who gained notoriety for their ability to \"throw\" their voices onto the bodies of artificial dummies, puppets, and marionettes. Although theoretically outmoded by recording technologies that make possible more seamless practices of voice-throwing, dubbing, and other visual and sonic manipulations, ventriloquism remains alive and well as a strategy within contemporary art and art history, already having been highlighted by artists dating back to Paul Klee and Jasper Johns. The case studies in this contemporary art seminar in oscillate seamlessly between art history, theory, and criticism through both analytical and performative means. This class shines light on what may seem an outdated practice, repositioning it as a conspicuous and meaningful trend within a range of artistic practices today. Artists to be examined include: Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla, Candice Breitz, Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller, Antoine Catala, Mel Chin, Anne Chu, Catherine Clover, Nina Elder, María Consuelo García, Gilbert and George, Guerilla Girls, Ann Hamilton, Sharon Hayes, Pablo Helguera, Pierre Huyghe, Christian Jankowski, Isaac Julien, Tadeusz Kantor, Mike Kelley, William Kentridge, Glenn Ligon, Kerry James Marshall, Courtney McClellan, Juan Muñoz, Bruce Nauman, Philippe Parreno, Wael Shawky, Lorna Simpson, Anna Deveare Smith, Henry Taylor, Kara Walker, Nora Wendl, Jordan Wolfson, and more. Finally, we will consider exhibitions that have literally and metaphorically invoked this theme, such as, for example, José Blondet’s Not I: Throwing Voices (1500 BCE–2020CE), staged at LACMA in 2018 and Ingrid Schaffner’s Puppet Show which toured in 2008 and beyond. Theoretical readings by Giorgio Agamben, Helene Cixous, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Fred Moten, Gayatri Spivak, and other philosophers and critics will be paired with individual artists and subthemes as well.",

We will study models found in our daily lives, through exhibition visits, from visiting lectures. Students are expected to bring their own references for discussion and inspiration, each generating a sourcebook for ideas and techniques over the course of the semester. Together we will share ideas and resources, building towards collaboration when applicable. \n\n\nThe coursework requires students to experiment with and apply the scaffolding methods using their own work and design practice. The semester is broken into three units of focus - each four classes in total. Each unit will include: examining models (either on site, with guest visitors, or in slides), & material experimentations in class, to culminate in final presentations and group critique. Students will work alone or in teams to problem solve material solutions for each thematic framework.",

Clinical trials have long been considered the gold standard for evaluating cause and effect. Nevertheless, interventions that have been proven efficacious in a controlled environment are not always beneficial when implemented in real-world clinical settings. Pragmatic trials explore the effectiveness of interventions when delivered in settings more closely resembling real-world practice. This course will provide an overview of the spectrum of pragmatic clinical trials, the components that make a trial more pragmatic, the advantages and disadvantages of typical pragmatic designs, special considerations required, best practices for conducting and reporting results, and a review of the various resources required to conduct a pragmatic trial.

Typography is not the dutiful application of a set of rules; however, both inherited and emerging conventions across various geographies and media are closely examined. Students learn to skillfully manipulate these conventions according to the conceptual, formal, and practical concerns of a given project. Supported by historical and contemporary writing and examples, assignments aim to develop observational and compositional skills across a variety of media, oscillating between micro- and macro-aesthetic concerns, from the design of individual letterforms to the setting of large texts, and everything in between. The course includes a short workshop in lettering, but the primary focus is on digitally generated typography and type design. Experimentation with nondigital processes is also encouraged. Students develop an increasingly refined and personal typographic vocabulary, customizing assignments according to their skills and interests.",

This course furthers that tradition by critiquing and discussing work by students from each department by those who are not familiar with the concerns, language, or material methods of a medium-specific field. By critique and analysis of each participant’s work, we attempt to break down the boundaries of medium and area. The course is designed for those who are interested in pushing medium orthodoxy aside to clear a space where and the development of language and renewed understandings are possible. Enrolled students exchange studio/desk visits with their classmates outside of class time as well as write about each other’s work. Each week, one shorter critique is offered by lottery to an M.F.A. student at the School of Art not enrolled in the class. This course is co-taught by multiple faculty and visiting critics, with one lead faculty member. Enrollment is limited. Permission of the instructor required.",

Accurate environmental and occupational exposure data are critical for (1) tracking changes in exposures over time, (2) investigating links with adverse health outcomes in epidemiologic analyses, (3) conducting risk assessments, and (4) comparing against regulatory standards. However, quantitative exposure data are difficult to collect, and often surrogate measures are used. This course focuses on providing tools to evaluate air, water, and physical stressors encountered in the indoor, outdoor, and occupational environment. Indirect and direct methods of assessing exposures in environmental and occupational settings are reviewed. Criteria for evaluating the quality of an exposure assessment and exposure data are discussed. The course covers the design of exposure assessment strategies for research and public health practice, the techniques and methods for sampling and analysis, and the interpretation of data. In addition, it incorporates aspects of inequities in environmental exposures (environmental justice). The class consists of lectures, discussions of readings and exposure data, and hands-on exposure monitoring.",

This evolving \"Nigerian visual novel\" or \"video novel,\" is defined by its loosely structured, tabloid-themed and reader-friendly style, all reflecting the craft of Nollywood films, a thriving video film culture that emerged in the 1990s and has remained popular globally. Through the study of Nollywood films alongside new Nigerian fiction, the course examines the techniques adopted by writers to accommodate the aesthetics of popular culture, to revive a declining readership, and to make literature more sellable. As these novels win literature prizes and find their way onto syllabi, the implications they have for our understanding of the African literary canon is discussed. Students view selected Nollywood movies and read a number of novels in the new genre in order to appraise the extent to which the serious and the sensuous intersect in this remaking of literariness. Seminar discussions are accompanied by short lectures in which concepts such as \"trans-mediality,\" \"reverse-adaptation,\" \"screen-to-page,\" \"appropriation,\" and \"quotation\" are discussed to build an understanding of how the \"new\" approach reconfigures Nigerian novels.",

Types of questions considered include: examining the comparative effectiveness and safety of clinical and public health interventions, disease etiology (risk factor analysis), diagnostic testing, and prognosis. Particular consideration is given to the methodology of synthesizing evidence in a systematic review. Also addressed is the role of evidence in informing economic analysis of health care programs, and clinical and public health practice guidelines. Using a problem-based approach, students contribute actively to the classes and small-group sessions. Students complete a systematic review in their own field of interest using Cochrane Collaboration methodology and software.",

        "description": "The Yale Interprofessional Longitudinal Clinical Experience (ILCE) course takes a group of first-year MD and PA students into several clinical sites throughout YNHH to practice obtaining a history and perform select portions of the physical examinations. The course entails didactics, simulation, and clinical experiences with patients. The Tutor (ILCE Practicum Elective participant) meets with a group of 4 students (combination of PA and MD ) over the course of 9 months (September-March) for a total of 14 sessions of 2 hours each. Tutors will be in a group of at least 2, and thus would only need to meet with the students for 7 sessions in the ED. These sessions are either on Monday or Friday (based on tutor preference), in the afternoon (any time starting at 1pm but ending by 6pm). Tutors will find 2-4 patients for the students to interview, and later in the course, do a limited physical while you observe and give them feedback. The Tutor will identify patients that are willing and able to have students interview them to obtain a history and then examine them. For the first half of the course, the students focus on accurate and thorough history-gathering. During the second half of the course (after December), the physical exam is added. Formative feedback will be offered throughout the experience. The students present the case to the facilitator and the rest of the group will observe the teaching and will offer feedback and help them hone their presentation skills. The group begins to generate a differential diagnosis and work-up plan with input from each student and the tutor. Direct observation is expected to aide in learning and offer feedback. Thus, facilitators should not be working clinically while they are teaching. Consequently, the facilitator will advise the scheduler to protect their schedule from clinical obligations when they are scheduled to meet with students. The facilitator will also verify that the students are aware of patient privacy regulations (HIPAA, etc.) and to lead debriefs in locations that can ensure privacy. All paper records that include HIPAA-sensitive information (e.g. EKGs, Lab result print-outs, etc) will be disposed of in appropriate receptacles and will NEVER leave the clinical, patient-care environments. Meetings with the Faculty Elective Director: The Tutor will meet with the Faculty Elective Director three times during the elective: The dates of these sessions should be decided on and scheduled before end of September. The first should be on second meeting with the students. The last should be close to the end of the course. The first two meetings will involved the faculty director direct observation of the tutor’s interaction with the students. The third meeting will include: 1) Debriefing on the entire course 2) Discussion of tutor’s final written report 3) Student feedback given to tutor throughout the course 4) Final student feedback given via Qualtrics Permission of the instructor required.",

Students will examine key approaches, including proximity-based planning (such as the 15-minute city, superblocks, and transit-oriented development) and community-driven interventions (such as tactical urbanism and informal mobility). Through lectures and case studies, the course traces the historical origins and evolution of these strategies, the motivations behind their adoption, and their intended and unintended impacts on urban sustainability. In a final project, students synthesize comparative evidence to evaluate the conditions that shape the effectiveness of these strategies. The course provides knowledge relevant for careers in policy, environmental management, urban planning, and related fields.",

The seminar will provide an in-depth examination of the history and theory of the law of secured credit transactions, including the development, enactment, and reform of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Discussions of the history of the subject will focus on the origins of the law of security interests in various types of tangible and intangible personal property, focusing on the development of security devices in England and the United States. Discussions of the theory of the subject will focus on various scholarly writings analyzing why security interests exist, their function, their utility, various problems that arise from having them, and possible reform. Two chapters of the course book used in the basic three-credit course are devoted to the history and theory of security devices, and we will focus on the materials in these chapters. Students should expect a lively discussion of the history and theory of secured transactions from a number of different perspectives. Enrollment in the basic three-credit Secured Transactions course concurrent with enrollment in the seminar, or a prior course in secured transactions under Article 9, is required. A seminar paper is also required. This course is cross-listed with the Law School and will follow the Law School academic calendar.",

Sometimes, a chance of life or death is literally at stake: how and when should a leader decide to let some people die, or explicitly ask people to die to give others a chance to live? At other times, while life or death may not be at stake, a leader must still decide difficult issues: when to partner with unsavory characters, when to admit failure, when to release information or make choices transparent. The pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and continued instability around the world all make clearer than ever the consequences of decisions in one community that can affect the entire world. This interdisciplinary seminar draws on perspectives from law, management, and public policy in exploring how leaders develop their principles, respond when their principles fail or conflict, and make real-world choices when, in fact, there are no good choices.

Continental in scope, the movement has also been called \"New Latin American Cinema\" joining the \"new waves\" of the global sixties and expanding its influence throughout the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement. The seminar examines the category of \"Third cinema,\" first formulated in Solanas's and Getino's 1969 \"Manifesto Towards a Third Cinema\" and opposed to \"First Cinema\" (Hollywood) and \"Second Cinema\" (\"cinema d’auteur\" or independent film art). The manifesto's political thinking will be framed in terms of contemporary political ideas about \"the third way\" or \"the non-aligned third world\" as well as put in dialogue with an array of film manifestos emerging at this time in the region. The seminar engages concepts such as \"imperfect cinema,\" \"urgent cinema,\" \"cinema novo,\" \"aesthetics of hunger,\" \"liberation cinema\"; the \"camera as expropiator of image-weapons,\" and so forth. The seminar casts a wide net in terms of the corpus, which includes a minimum of two films per week, from countries such as Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, and Mexico.

Mechanical eyes, such as satellites, rovers, computer vision, and autonomous sensing devices, give us unprecedented access to nonhuman and superhuman views into known and unknown environments. But the technology of automatic observation alienates human observers and fools them into thinking that this is an unemotional, inhuman point of view due to its existence in a numeric or digital domain. The observer is looking at seemingly trustworthy data that has been \"flattened\" or distilled from the real world. But this face-value acceptance should be rejected; interpreters of this device data should interrogate the motives, biases, or perspectives informing the \"artist\" in this case (that is, the developer/programmer/engineer who created the devices). Despite the displacement of direct human observation, mechanical eyes present in remote sensing, LiDAR scanning, trail-cams, metagenomic sequencing, urban informatics, and hyperspectral imaging have become fundamental to spatial analysis. But as these become standard practice, observers should also be trained in cracking open the data to understand the human perspective that originally informed it. In this class, students investigate the impact of the mechanical eye on cultural and aesthetic inquiry into a specific site. They conceptually consider their role as interpreter for the machine and create a series of site analysis experiments across a range of mediums. The experiments are based on themes of inversion, mirroring, portraiture, memory, calibration, and foregrounding to \"unflatten\" data into structure and form. Limited enrollment.",

Together, we will examine how Buddhism addresses fundamental moral and ethical questions, such as: How should I behave? What are the implications of my actions? What is good and bad? How can we bridge the gap between knowing what is right and acting accordingly? The course is divided into two parts. In the first part, we will explore foundational topics in Buddhist ethics, focusing on themes such as retribution, precepts, the Bodhisattva’s path, meditation, and the role of feelings. The second part centers on Buddhism’s responses to contemporary ethical issues, including abortion, gender, race, and environmental ethics. This course integrates both the theory and practice of ethics. The structure and assignments are designed to help you engage with theoretical systems that may differ from those you are familiar with, while also applying these abstract ideas to reflect on the relationship between theory and practice.",

What if, instead of depleting our planet’s forests, peatlands, and wetlands, the making of buildings and cities could incentivize their restoration and enhance biodiversity while rebalancing socioeconomic inequity? As both the science and technical means of biospheric management evolve, concurrent innovations in bio-based and circular economic construction and associated methods of impact assessment offer the possibility for a new and powerful symbiosis between healthy ecosystems and convivial urban growth. In an era of big data, bioregional synergies can be analyzed and predicted through extrapolative methodologies using broad datasets and powerful computational models. But they must also be explored, tested, and implemented through empirical means, simultaneously, in regional ecosystems and the urban areas that would rely on them and provide critical feedback. Through a range of readings, analytical exercises, and material and assembly tests, the seminar engages advanced concepts and methods of regenerative design and construction and posits system change for global building.",

Historically, the plan was the means through which architects deployed principles of proportion, composition, uniformity, montage, and figuration. It expresses the underlying ethics and ideologies of the architecture; evidences the background environment of building technologies, rules, regulations, conventions, and customs; and traces the power relations that buildings enact. The recent return of the plan as a topic of discourse and focus of architectural energy suggests renewed interest in the correlation of form and politics that the plan describes. This course sketches the history of plan making in the west during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from Beaux Arts composition to modern \"non-composition,\" before focusing on the scattershot discourse about the plan today. Rather than positing a single grand thesis about the contemporary plan, the course foregrounds the countless threads of plan making evident today and asks students to identify the underlying ideas, histories, and implications of specific plans.",

We will focus on ways that architects created reconstructions out of the surviving fragments of the past – from 19th century polychromatic reconstructions to contemporary digital work. The second unit, \"techniques\" explores reconstruction methods, from singular restorationist approaches to contemporary practices that acknowledge the differing and complex experiences of beholders. The final unit, \"restitutions\" explores the shifting meaning of reconstructions relative to a nation’s politics. In this last unit we will examine the way reconstructions negotiate the politics of historic reckoning, colonial histories, and environmentalist demands, among other concerns.

Surveying a wide range of buildings, objects, infrastructures, and landscapes across the Atlantic World, our aim is to understand how the built environment evolved to guide practices of capital accumulation—from the plantations of the early modern Caribbean to the \"supertalls\" of Billionaires’ Row. Readings draw from a growing body of scholarly literature that approaches design as an agent of political economy as opposed to a reflection of pre-existing ideas and economic structures. The seminar’s case studies therefore emphasize the reciprocity between themes of architectural and capitalist modernity (e.g., Circulation, Development) as well as the spatial forms and extractive processes that accompany them. Course work results in new critical perspectives for the historical study of present-day spatial inequality. Moreover, moving beyond familiar narratives and geographies of modernity, we will consider design’s relation to not only the production of wealth, but also counter-models of local autonomy, mutual aid, and redistribution.",

        "description": "If we are to rethink architecture now, as we must, we need also to rethink its relations to computation. In homage to Tony Vidler’s \"Architecture Dismembered\", this seminar examines the historic, and now uncanny, doubling of architecture with not the body but with the long and inevitable project of computation, itself ironically a project to de-corporealize thought and render it automatic. In the sessions we consider the ideations of architecture and computation as ever-entangled, if not co-constitutive, arguing, tout court, that without architectural imagination the computer would not be the same, and vice versa. A historiographic dismembering of the architect’s various discrete (and indiscreet) machines reveals shared: memory storage and retrieval systems; mechanisms for deletion and forgetting; windows, guns, pens, nozzles; universal languages, algorithms and other compressive strategies in the calculation of true products; taming of chance by prediction. Like Humpty Dumpty, once apart, they will not go back together again and thus complicate beyond retrieval the already waning platitudes of optimisation and digital solutionism. Instead they suggest potential new categories with which to mutually reconstitute architecture’s relations to computation: the appetite; the mediocre; the alienated; the duped and the promise of the automatic.",

Semiotics’ foundational goal consisted in retracing how meaning emerges in these objects and operations, how it circulates within and between different cultural environments, and how it affects and is affected by the cultural contexts in which these objects and operations are embedded. To revamp semiotics’ main tasks, after an introduction about the idea of \"making meaning,\" the seminar engages students in a weekly discussion about situations, procedures, objects, and attributes that are \"meaningful,\" in the double sense that they have meaning and they arrange reality in a meaningful way. Objects of analysis are intentionally disparate; the constant application of a set of analytical tools provides the coherence of the seminar. Students are expected to regularly attend the seminar, actively participate in discussions, propose new objects of analysis, present a case study (fifteen–twenty minutes), and write a final paper (max. 5,000 words).

        "description": "Although the built environment shapes multi-sensory experience, Western architects since antiquity have upheld the mind/body split, framing architecture as a medium primarily apprehended through vision and hearing—senses historically associated with male reason, abstract thinking, and the scientific method. Meanwhile, they have marginalized the so-called \"lower\" senses—touch, taste, and smell—linked to the abject physical body and the material world. And while buildings are constructed from solid materials extracted from the natural environment, architects have largely ignored the haptic sensations elicited when corporeal beings engage with the material world, considered a female principle, associated with Mother Earth. This course challenges these problematic assumptions by situating them in a techno-historical context. We will examine the intertwined histories of architecture and sensory-enhancing technologies that privilege seeing and hearing—from the Renaissance camera obscura to 20th-century glass curtain walls to 21st-century smartphones. These technologies have shaped both the design of built environments and our sensory experience of space in ways that reinforce the mind/body split and exclude those who do not conform to able-bodied norms. Critically examining these techno-sensory developments through the lens of gender and disability will allow us to propose alternative futures. How can we learn from the experiences of people with physical and sensory disabilities, as well as from ethnic and religious communities whose engagement with the built environment draws on different senses, faculties, and customs? How can we harness technological innovations that augment sensory perception to design immersive, inclusive environments—spaces that promote meaningful human interaction among people with diverse embodied identities as they navigate both virtual and physical realms? *",

        "description": "This course will be offered to graduate and undergraduate students who wish to pursue their own special talents, follow their passions, and expand possibilities and creative impulses to create a small object of their own design. The course is cross-listed with Architecture, Neuroscience, and Engineering & Applied Science (SEAS) and will intentionally bring together students with different backgrounds and experiences. The course explores the ideation, design processes, and fabrication of a functioning prototype. A \"small object\" is defined as something that is able to fit comfortably through a standard doorway. Potential areas of exploration include, but are not limited to: jewelry, furniture, experimental scientific instruments, electronic devices, architectural objects, lighting, cutlery, packaging, and musical instruments. Student selection is competitive and through application only. Proposal submissions are due by Aug. 18 (mid-night), with preference given to graduate students in Architecture, Neuroscience, and SEAS. Previous experience building your small object is not required. Passion for your object—and for building it—are critical for a successful proposal and for success in the course. (Example proposals will be provided with course description material.) Each student will be able to follow their own path as they acquire professional-level competencies in designing and creating their small object, with an understanding that design disciplines are increasingly expanding and converging. As such, students will be encouraged to explore as many university resources as possible to achieve the desired outcome. The methodology used to complete tasks in this course will give students an understanding of a typical industrial design process while equipping them with skills, concepts, and tools used to create scientific-grade instrumentation. The course will encourage creative and scientific exploration, while fostering an interdisciplinary nexus for fabrication technology, design pedagogy, and problem-solving. While each student will pursue an individual project, true innovation often results from cross-pollination between disciplines. To facilitate interdisciplinary interaction and expand possibility, students from different disciplines will work together as they explore the development and fabrication of their small object. Weekly reviews will be coupled with training and seminars. Students will also have access to multiple state-of-the-art design and fabrication facilities that include manual and computer-controlled manufacturing machines, electronic equipment, rapid prototyping tools, and computer aided drafting (CAD) and rendering programs. Students will be exposed to design drawing techniques, physical modeling methods, and the concept of designing for manufacture. Students will acquire professional-level competence in two- and three-dimensional design—using aesthetic sensibility, digital/analog tools, and critical thinking—combined with a working knowledge of materials and methods in an environmentally responsible context. The course will be structured around teaching modules, studio time, and critique periods. During class sessions, students will be encouraged to actively engage in critiquing their fellow students’ work. Technique workshops covering different project-related types of fabrication will be held during the second half of the semester. Enrollment is limited to no more than 9 students.",

Through detailed case studies of structural and architectural disasters, the course examines how miscalculations, human error, design flaws, mismanagement, and unforeseen conditions can lead to catastrophic outcomes. More than a technical postmortem, these failures are also considered within their broader political, cultural, environmental, and professional contexts. What went wrong? Why did it happen? What were the consequences—not just for the buildings themselves, but for the people who used, built, and designed them? The course also looks at how these failures have prompted changes in building codes, engineering standards, professional ethics, and architectural practice. By studying what did not work, students gain critical insight into what it means to build responsibly, learning to anticipate risk, question assumptions, and navigate the complex realities of the practice of architecture. Each student selects a building failure to research and presents their findings in class. Through this process, the course aims to develop more thoughtful, critical, and ethically grounded designers – aware not only of how things are built, but of how things can go wrong.",

The seminar focuses on the American context, but the definition of American boundaries is open to interpretation and contestation.

We engage with current discourses on race and architecture and link them to discussions on media, politics, and the contested project of the American nation.

As our sea levels have risen, so too has the extreme socioeconomic disparity of specific communities and countries, creating a drowning class of climate refugees. Entire countries on the front lines of sea-level rise face the specter of nationhood without territory, despite the undeniable fact that their contribution to this global problem is negligible. And if climate change is in fact \"the result of human activity since the mid-20th century,\" it is in actuality a largely male-made phenomenon, if we unpack the gender dynamics and underlying power structures of the proto-G8 nations, the self-proclaimed leaders of industrialization. These power dynamics become even further exacerbated as we consider the implications of the particularly American interest in doubling down on investing in the heaviest piece of infrastructure ever—climate engineering. The architectural community appears to be in agreement. Climate change is a fundamental design problem. And yet calls to action have been ineffectual, responses underwhelming in the face of this overwhelming challenge. As the architectural community is eagerly poised to jump on the design bandwagon, this course seeks to reveal, foreground, empower, and give physical form to the spatial dimensions and power dynamics of the people and places most impacted by climate change. More broadly, the course aspires to help students develop their own critical stance on climate change and the role architects play.",

Working in teams directly with local community-based non-profits, students will co-create detailed development proposals anchored by affordable housing, but which also engage with a range of community development issues including environmental justice, sustainability, resilience, social equity, identity, food scarcity, mobility, and health. Through seminars and workshops with Yale faculty and guest practitioners in the field, students will be introduced to the history, theory, issues, and contemporary practices in this field, and will get direct feedback on their work. Offered in partnership with the Connecticut Department of Housing (DOH) as part of the Connecticut Plan for Healthy Cities, proposals will have the opportunity to receive funding from the State both towards the implementation of rapidly deployed pilot projects during the course period, as well as towards predevelopment activities for larger projects, such as housing rehabilitation or new building construction. Students will interact with the Connecticut Commissioner of Housing and the Connecticut Green Bank.",

        "description": "Recent surges in the last 500 years of colonizing, capitalizing, and globalizing may be more treacherous and untraceable than those of previous empires. This course exposes their infrastructures. While it begins with the global colonial extraction networks, most of the material circles around the spatial apparatus deployed toward the end of the 20th century that accompanied what is often amnesically referred to as \"globalization.\" This infrastructure is not only the infrastructure of pipes and wires underground but also the ubiquitous enveloping urban medium of repeatable formulas for space—a human/nonhuman socio-technical space that is rapidly producing a new layer of the earth’s crust. Critiqued by both the left and the populist right this massive physical plant contains a spectrum of dangers: capitalism, fascism, racism, whiteness, settler colonialism, femicide, caste, xenophobia, psychotic leadership, and countless other ways of hoarding power, abusing people, and damaging the planet. The story resists and exceeds any easy ideological explanations or definitions of the neoliberalism with which this moment is associated–a moment when, not rational actors and nation states, but an often irrational extrastatecraft, deploys stealthy, bullet-proof forms of power. Discussion is interspersed with heavily illustrated talks that encounter: instant free zone world cities, satellite urbanism and broadband from the perspective of Non-Aligned countries in South Asia and Africa, labor, conflict, and climate migration, an agripole in Southern Spain, automated ports, islands and offshore financial centers as the confetti of multiple empires, contagious spatial products of commerce and tourism, a cruise ship to the DPRK, the standards and management platforms of ISO, sweatshops, tax havens, and exploding urban peripheries among many other things. Going beyond the anointed legal, scientific, and econometric languages, the seminar also uncovers forms of spatially-embedded activism to meet this moment. The evidence returns to moments of worldmaking solidarity within newly independent colonies in the Global South—solidarities between the Pan-African, Non-Aligned, Tricontinental, and civil rights movements that the Global North broke by further tilting the playing fields in their own favor. And the seminar considers the infrastructures that dominant infrastructures eclipsed—live infrastructures of land, water, atmosphere, and community—to be as worthy of public support as infrastructures of concrete and conduit. As reparations for patterns of harm that will otherwise only continue, these alternative infrastructures are inextricably linked to climate change and planetary concerns. If the global conjures associations with White Enlightenment modern universals, singular evils and singular solutions, planetary conjures the patchy, partial, multiple approaches in the pluriverse. Treating everyone as a designer, the course is an adventure in thinking as well as a mixing chamber for disciplines across the university: social sciences, arts, economics, business history, science and technology studies, history of science, organization studies, informatics, media and communication studies, architecture and urbanism. Cultural ephemera is screened as a prelude to each lecture. Weekly readings offer evidence, discursive commentary, and critique. Tutorials help to shape group work.",

        "description": "Architectural ruins index the total failure of individual buildings, technologies, economies, or, at times, entire civilizations. This course researches the topics of ruination and architectural ruins—what produces them, what defines them, and how they impact individuals, cities, and civilizations on levels from the visual and formal to the philosophical and psychological. The formal and visual materials of this course emerge from the study of ruins from not only the past and present, but also the future, through research into the speculative territories of online \"ruin porn,\" new genres of art practice, and in particular dystopian television and film projects that reveal an intense contemporary cultural interest in apocalyptic themes. While significant nineteenth-century theories of architectural ruination, including those of John Ruskin (anti-restoration) and Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (pro-restoration), are addressed, the primary intellectual position of the course emerges from readings and discussions of the philosophical methodology of \"ruination.\" Student projects involve the philosophical and aesthetic ruination of iconic architectural projects to determine not only their essential qualities, but hidden, latent ones as well. Subsequent group discussion of this work vacillates between philosophical and aesthetic poles in an attempt to tease out new observations on these projects as well as on the nature of ruins and ruination. The self-designed final project is determined pending consultation between the students and instructor, but involves photorealistic failure of past, present, or future architectural or urban projects; dystopic visual speculations; fabrication experiments that test actual material decay and failure; or attempts to reproduce the aesthetic ambitions of ruin porn through the manipulation of existing, or the design of new, projects. The goal of the course is not to convey an existing body of architectural knowledge, but to unearth a new architectural discourse that considers architecture in reverse—emphasizing its decay rather than its creation in an effort to reveal new territories of architectural agency.

        "description": "The notion of play occupies a special place in the history of modern art and architecture. Theorized in the 19th century by Friedrich Froebel as fundamental to the process by which children learn, play would form the basis of Froebel’s kindergarten, now a model for early childhood education worldwide. The aesthetic intensity of Froebel’s program would likewise contribute to a variety of radical educational projects in the 19th and 20th centuries, including the Bauhaus. Later, Johan Huizinga’s seminal meditation on the \"play element in culture,\" Homo Ludens, would provide an intellectual foundation for a number of 20th century aesthetic and political movements, among them the Situationist International. Finally, a generous focus on play has recently reemerged within the discourse on a range of 21st century art and design practices, characterized by a shared focus on participation and performativity, as in the work of Rirkrit Tiravanija and Lottie Child. This course, then, explores the place and problem of play in three ways: as a critical framework for understanding the aesthetic qualities of the human environment; as a mode of experience, giving meaning to that environment; and as a working method employed by artists and architects as a specific form of practice.",

        "description": "Course Introduction Ink proposes a creative and critical inquiry into ink’s instrumentality in architecture to delineate a subtle story—a latent history of architecture in ink—placing ink in our world with the purpose of gaining knowledge within and for the architectural discipline. A close consideration of the varied conceptual and material aspects of ink acts as a medium to reflect upon the means by which architectural knowledge is generated, articulated, and applied. Course Structure The course will be structured by the abecedary, ink or \"V is for Vermilion as described by Vitruvius\" An A to Z of Ink in Architecture. Composed from various material forms of ink found in studio, an alphabet in 26 images was created and sent as an invitation to 26+ architects, artists, historians, theorists, scholars, inventors and poets to write a brief entry on a discrete ink object. On the first day of class, 13 of the 26 letters will be selected at random and a single letter assigned to each week of the course. Each week, the class will closely examine the ink objects described by diverse voices in the entries written under the assigned letter— conceptually and materially—by reading, in discussion and in drawings. Reading: Each entry describing a discrete ink object is typically brief—generally 500 to 1000 words; the 26 letters contain between 1-5 entries each on average. Weekly reading will be assigned by letter to be discussed in class. Discussion: Each week the class will discuss the ink entries under a single letter to create collective word images. Drawing (in-class/in-studio): Students will spend time each class period using drawing to explore material and conceptual aspects of the ink objects. [These drawings may provide material for the weekly out-of-class assignments. Students will keep a folio of A3 loose-leaf sheets that can be pinned up and compiled for reference and review. In addition, there may be collective in-class drawings, done on larger paper that will be in response to discussion in class. They will be due at the end of the class period. Supplemental ink materials may be provided by the instructor.] Drawing (out-of-class assignments): Students will construct an architectural drawing(s) each week for the letter discussed in class, due at the beginning of the next class (for pin-up/discussion). [Students will determine four parameters for each architectural drawing: scale (ie. measured drawing), view (ie. projection: parallel, oblique, orthographic, isometric, perspective), set (format), and sequence. These architectural drawings may be manual and/or digital. The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscripts Library, a container formed of ink that contains ink, will form the basis of these drawings.] Pin-ups: Weekly drawing assignments will be reviewed weekly. Before each week’s discussion, you should pin-up with the rest of your studio group to facilitate an efficient discussion. Reviews: For Mid review, architectural drawing of a single entry from ink by the student’s choice (not covered in the 13 assigned letters) will be constructed. For Final review, students may delineate a new entry for the abecedary, ink. Mid and Final reviews will include outside critics. Evaluation: Each drawing assignment will be evaluated for a) technique and b) completion. After each pin-up and during the in-class exercise the professor will give an evaluation that will then be recorded by the TF. If a drawing needs improvement to satisfactorily meet the requirements of the assignment, the student will be asked to make these improvements for re-evaluation. All assignments must meet this standard to successfully pass the course. Course Requirements Attendance at all class sessions is mandatory, in accordance with YSoA policy. More than two unexcused absences constitute failure of the class. Out-of-class drawing assignments must be completed by 6pm on the Thursday before the date they are reviewed. Drawings are to be saved for comprehensive review at the end of the term and submitted digitally as directed by the Teaching Fellow.",

        "description": "How do we make design a more profitable practice? Design business has traditionally positioned building as a commodity in the delivery supply chain, valued by clients like other products and services purchased at lowest first cost. Despite the fact that the building sector in its entirety operates in large capital pools where significant value is created, intense market competition, sole focus on differentiation by design quality, and lack of innovation in project delivery and business models have resulted in a profession that is grossly underpaid and marginally profitable. The profession must explore new techniques for correlating the real value of an architect’s services to clients and thereby break the downward pressure on design compensation. This seminar redesigns the value proposition of architecture practice, explores strategies used by better-compensated adjacent professions and markets, and investigates methods by which architects can deliver—and be paid for—the value they bring to the building industry. Prerequisite: ARCH 2031 or equivalent strongly recommended. Limited enrollment.",

        "description": "Current sustainability discourse labels many existing buildings as ‘bad.’ Hooked on fossil fuels, leaky and inefficient, existing buildings are penalized for their carbon footprint by cities and policymakers to provoke energy renovations and upgrades. New, ‘Net Zero Carbon’ buildings have been the sustainability focus of the AEC industry – all-electric, highly efficient, technologically advanced, these ground up buildings have been heralded as climate saviors. This seminar presents the opposite as true: new, ‘Net Zero’ buildings are a distraction, not our salvation. It is the existing ‘bad’ buildings, the messy fabric all around us, that do pose a carbon challenge, but also hold a profound solution to achieving a low carbon future. All new buildings, regardless of their operational carbon efficiency, release over half of their lifetime emissions during construction as embodied carbon. As we try to reduce emissions now to limit warming to 2°C, the focus of the architecture community must turn to what is already built around us. And we have inherited an urban fabric of ‘bad buildings,’ with old envelopes, outdated fossil fuel-based mechanical systems, and complicated equipment built over decades. Upgrading these buildings to be more carbon efficient is essential, but it is expensive, messy, and thankless work. Building owners must be able to extract value from this type of significant capital investment: they won’t decarbonize a building without a value proposition, change in program, market target, or commercial offering. The essential and urgent task of decarbonizing existing buildings presents both architectural challenges and carbon opportunities, and the truth is that no one has figured out how to make it happen yet. In pursuit of new solutions grounded in practice, this seminar will follow two tracks: the technical and theoretical. The technical side will cover reuse (embodied carbon) and retrofit (operational carbon) through lectures, guest speakers, and short assignments. The theoretical track will cover case studies and readings on adaptive reuse and architectural proposition. The seminar will culminate with studentinitiated proposals for decarbonizing and reinventing an existing building in New York City.",

Drawing, historically the primary means of generation, presentation, and interrogation of design ideas, is currently ill-defined and under stress. This course examines the historical and theoretical development of descriptive geometry and perspective through the practice of rigorous constructed architectural drawings. The methods and concepts studied serve as a foundation for the development of drawings that consider the relationship between a drawing’s production and its conceptual objectives. Weekly readings, discussions, and drawing exercises investigate the work of key figures in the development of orthographic and three-dimensional projection. Ultimately, the goal is to engage in a focused dialogue about the practice of drawing and different methods of spatial inquiry. Limited enrollment.",

        "description": "From the beginning of the twentieth century to the present, urbanization has gradually come to dominate political, economic, social, and cultural landscapes of the contemporary world. To be urban was to be modern, and the development of modern social theory relied on using the city as its research laboratory. Two decades into the twenty-first century, features of urbanization such as density, resource extraction, environmental degradation, and intense social inequalities appear to be ubiquitous across different geopolitical conditions. This course presents students with a range of theories that attempt to make sense of the variegated and intersecting conditions that define contemporary urban localities. Building on the understanding offered by these theories, we conclude with an exploration of emerging positions, concepts, and propositions that enable new ways of understanding the centrality of urbanism within a world dominated by uncertainty, speculation, and dystopia.",
